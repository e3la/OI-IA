    "The previous definition of databases indicated that databases include _**records.**_ The relevant definition of [records](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#record) in the ODLIS is\n",
    "\n",
    "> In computing, a collection of related [data](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#data) [fields](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#field) organized and [accessible](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accessibility) as a single entity. A [machine-readable data file](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mrdf) is a collection of such records.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ERIC database you just looked at, each record represents an article: [https://eric.ed.gov/?q=lady+gaga&id=EJ1101453 ](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=lady+gaga&id=EJ1101453)\n",
    "\n",
    "And when you clicked on the records to open them, you saw very organized content laid out in a pre-defined way. In fact, you were looking at a display for the fields that compose the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fields in Database Records\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, surrogates are a kind of record in a database. All database records tend to have fields, or \"a logical unit of information\"; ... \"for example, the name, address, or phone number field\"—in your Contacts in your phone, or in any number of other systems ([\"Field\", n.d.](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#field)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Fields is a term that can mean different things in the information professions. Here are two definitions of field ([https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis\\_f.aspx#field](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#field)) from the ODLIS that pertain to database records: \n",

    "> In [library](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) [cataloging](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloging), a relative location of [fixed](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#fixedfield) or [variable](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_v.aspx#variablefield) length in a [machine-readable](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#machinereadable) [record](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord), reserved for a specific [data](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#data) [element](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#element) or group of elements that constitute a single logical category of [bibliographic description](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdescrip), for example, the [area](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#area) of [physical description](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#physicaldescrip) reserved for [information](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) about the physical characteristics of an [item](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem). In the [MARC](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#machinecat) record, each field is indicated by a three-digit [tag](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#tag), but in the [catalog](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalogrecord) display, textual [field label](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#fieldlabel)s are provided to assist users in identifying the various categories of description. ...   \n",
    "> Fields for [area](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#area)s of description containing more than one data element are divided into [subfields](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subfield). Only about 10 percent of available MARC fields are used in most [bibliographic records](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord); the other 90 percent are used infrequently. **_See also_**: [control field](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#controlfield), [directory](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#directory), [leader](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#leader), [local field](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#localfield), and [variable data field](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_v.aspx#variabledata).\n",
    "\n",
    "> In a more general sense, a logical unit of data that, together with other units, comprises a record in a [database](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#database) or other system of [recordkeeping](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#recordkeeping), for example, the name, address, or phone number field of each [patron record](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#patronrecord) in a library's [patron](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#patron) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch this short video from the ERIC database about searching in the database. Note how the terms \"records\" and \"fields\" are used—each is used multiple times so you will need to pay close attention. Also note the term \"descriptors\" which is another term that will be important to retrieval.\n"

The web page isn't the book itself, but the information provided stands in for the book. Amazon also has surrogates for other items, like toothbrushes ([click here](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-ProtectiveClean-Rechargeable-HX6810/dp/B078GVMVRH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=TY248EB2EU3G&keywords=toothbrushes&qid=1580220747&s=hpc&sprefix=toothbrushes%2Cstripbooks%2C167&sr=1-5)). All the surrogates, whether for information-as-thing or other kinds of items  serve the exact same purpose.
