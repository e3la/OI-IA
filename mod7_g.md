Key Ideas in IO: Preservation Metadata
======================================

**Defining Preservation Metadata**
----------------------------------

Gililand (2016) defines preservation metadata in the following way:

> Metadata related to the preservation management of collections and information resources
> 
> (Gilliland, 2016, section Categorizing Metadata).

Going back to the idea of the one-to-one principle, you can image that the tasks of preserving an illuminated manuscript from 1300 CE, preserving the surrogate for that object, and preserving a digitized version of the manuscript are all very different activities indeed! 

In the scenario above, three different items need to be preserved. Preservation metadata supporting information about each may be stored in the information system. 

**Key Ideas in IO: Digital Preservation**
-----------------------------------------

Wikipedia defines digital preservation as a "formal endeavor to ensure that digital information of continuing value remains accessible and usable." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation)

Preservation metadata plays a role in ensuring long-term accessibility and usability of digital objects by providing documentation about digital files, including information about the file format and changes to digital files. For special types of digital files, information about the software needed to access the file is critical. You have already seen how some metadata categories overlap. That is particularly true with preservation metadata. In order to ensure long-term preservation, administrative and technical metadata must be recorded, too. 

_For more details, read the Wikipedia entry._

**Examples of Preservation Metadata Properties and Their Uses**
---------------------------------------------------------------

Riley (2017) provides examples of preservation metadata properties and their uses in the NISO primer. 

**Table 1 Example Properties and Primary Uses for Preservation Metadata** **(Riley, 2017, p. 7)**

#### **Metadata Type**

#### **Primary Uses**

Preservation metadata

Checksum

Preservation event

Interoperability

Digital object management

Preservation

_Checksum_ and _Preservation event_ are the example properties mentioned, but these terms and the ideas they represent might be unfamiliar to you. 

#### What Is a Checksum?

According to the glossary for the Society of American Archivists, a [checksum](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/checksum.html) is the following:

> **checksum**
> 
> n. a unique alphanumeric value that represents the bitstream of an individual computer file or set of files
> 
> **Notes**
> 
> The term checksum is often used interchangeably with other types of fixity tools such as cryptographic hash values generated by algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Checksums or hashes are used in the context of digital preservation, such as during the process of transferring or storing files, in order to determine whether files have been inadvertently altered. For example, an archivist can compare checksums or hashes generated before and after file transfer to determine whether the file has maintained the same value through the transfer process.

Take a moment to read the Wikipedia article on checksums: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum)

What does this mean? Sometimes digital files degrade, just like paper ones. The "decay" is best detected by confirming the "fixity" of an item using checksums. 

#### What Is a Preservation Event?

According to PREMIS (PREMIS Editorial Committee, 2015), an _event_ is defined as

> An action that involves or affects at least one Object or Agent associated with or known by the preservation repository (p. 7).

An event is an action. Examples of events that may be recorded include the digital file being updated to a new file format and migration of the file to a different system.

**Examples of Preservation Metadata**
-------------------------------------

As Gilliland (2016)'s examples show, both physical and digital preservation can be supported in a system through the use of preservation metadata. 

> *   Documentation of physical condition of resources
> *   Documentation of actions taken to preserve physical and digital versions of resources (e.g., data refreshing and migration)
> *   Documentation of any changes occurring during digitization or preservation
> 
> (Gilliland, 2016, section Categorizing Metadata)

These examples show how information can be recorded in a system regarding the object and the digital object—all of which facilitates the management and administration of the database.
