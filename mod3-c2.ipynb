Think of one possible type of information resource that might be used to fulfill that need and identify one retrieval system or tool that might be used to as the information intermediary. Those are the major components of the information retrieval process, but they are not enough for success. Consider what is needed for a successful outcome and consider some of the hindrances that might block that success.
