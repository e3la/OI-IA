# Metadata in LAMs

Shifting to focus more specifically on the metadata created and used in LAMs, this page shares content from the field. Although previous readings have mentioned the uses of metadata, the following excerpts from documents issued by a standards body and by information agencies highlight the purposes of metadata from their points of view.Â 

If you are interested in library cataloging or IO of artifacts, be sure to open these resources to learn more.

## In Their Own Words

From [RDA: Resources Description and Access ](https://www.rdatoolkit.org/)(cataloging content standard used widely in libraries in the United States, Europe, and, increasingly, in other countries):

> These metadata are intended to support the discovery and identification of resources in library and other cultural heritage collections. (Introduction to RDA, RDA beta)

From the [National Parks Services, Museum handbook, Part II](https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/MHII.pdf):

> Catalog records give you access to information about your museum collection for research and interpretation. They are also the primary property accountability records for museum objects. Catalog records tell you what objects you have, their condition, and where they're located. They provide physical and intellectual access to your museum collection. (p. 3.1)

From [The Small Museums Cataloguing Manual](https://amagavic.org.au/assets/Small_Museums_Cataloguing_Manual_4th.pdf):

> Documenting an object enriches its intrinsic value. The accumulation of information gives an object meaning and context, and results in a stronger understanding of its uniqueness, its contributions to the collection and its reason for being collected in the first place. (p. 12

**Reflect on the importance of metadata to the services identified by these information agencies:**

*   Discovery and identification
*   Access
*   Information about resources
*   Context for resources
*   Promotion of resources
