# Organizing Information in Information Agencies.

This material was developed and authored by Heather Moulaison Sandy and Felicity Dykas and funded in part by a grant from the University of Missouri System. 

This OER was created for ISLT 7302, a core course in the MLIS Program at the iSchool at the University of Missouri. Core courses typically are taken as classes at the beginning of your program of study, generally completed before most elective courses. Accordingly, this course material is introductory in nature, with the goal of setting students up for understanding the field of organization of information (IO) which might be very new to them. It also should help provide perspective on how IO is related to most other work carried out in the information professions.

IO is a field with a lot of precise terminology. Some call it _jargon_ or _professional jargon_, others call it_ terms of art_.

Tips:



*   Develop the practice of reading so as to understand terms (especially ones that might be _professional jargon_) that are new to you. If you do not understand a term, take the time look it up.
*   Remember that terms used in LIS (library and information science) may be defined differently in other disciplines. Be careful of the definition you accept.
*   Read actively! Take your own notes. Look things up. Explore research in the area. Look into examples from practice. Re-read anything that remains unclear.

## Abstract

Investigate the "behind the scenes" work of making information resources available, especially in online environments supported by information agencies and cultural heritage institutions. Learn about how users are supported by these systems, and consider how best to address some of their complexities, including those resulting from the biases that all of us have.

## Overview by Module


### **Part I: Introduction to Essential Concepts**

#### Learning Objectives: In this Part, you will learn about information, what we mean by “organization of information” and “information retrieval."

Module 1. Perspectives on Information (and Its Organization)

Module 2. Introduction to Retrieval and Retrieval Systems & Tools

Module 3. Organization in LAMS (Principles, Key Terms, Ideas, & Products of Cultural Heritage Institutions)

Module 4. Historical Approaches to IO and Key Players


### **Part II: Metadata to Support Organization of Information**

#### Learning Objectives: In this part, you will learn about a variety of kinds of metadata used to organize material for retrieval in information agencies.

Module 5. Descriptive Metadata

Module 6. Subject Access and Categorization

Module 7. Other Kinds of Metadata

### **Part III: Systems to Support Organization of Information**

#### Learning Objectives: In this part, you will learn about the technology used to allow access in IO environments. This technology is known as “systems” and it relies on databases, specialized search engines, and encoded information.

Module 8. Systems and System Design in Catalogs

Module 9. Systems and System Design in Digital Libraries

Module 10. Focus: Linked Data

Module 11. Other Content and Other Systems for IO (PIM, RDM, DAMS, etc.)


### **Part IV: Ethics in Organization of Information**

#### Learning Objectives: In this part, we focus on  improving IO as a field—where the field of IO is going, and how it can better make an impact.

Module 12. For-Profit Information Systems

Module 13. Universal KOSs: Representing Users and Meeting their Needs

Module 14. Data about People in IO

Module 15. Being an Ethical Professional
