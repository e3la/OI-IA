Think about it: if a system knows where you are, what your interests are, what you have used in the past, and what other people like you enjoy, it will be better able to find the best, most relevant resources to suggest to you. What can possibly go wrong?\n",

A million dollars (read about this online at any number of webpages, including [here](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-netflix-prize)). If you are an avid Netflix user, then you already benefit from recommender systems that take the pain out of searching.\n",

They can perform a great service for users, but at what cost? With something like Netflix, perhaps films that challenge standard mores and values might be downplayed in favor of more mainstream entertainment? Much as the example with Google showed, there can be a lot that goes on \"under the hood\" at the discretion of the enterprise that owns the resource.\n",

It uses subject headings assigned by libraries and the most common tags applied to your books by all LibraryThing members, so even if you don't tag, you can still generate recommendations. The computer adjusts recommendations (weights) based on tag/subject obscurity—so the fact that two books share the widely-used tag 'fiction' counts less towards making them similar than if they share the tag 'books about books' or 'dystopian steampunk'. If you share a lot of unusual books with another LT member, you may find that the algorithm suggests other items from these similar libraries.\"\n",
