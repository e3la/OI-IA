Key Ideas in IO: Technical Metadata
===================================

**Defining Technical Metadata**
-------------------------------

What is technical metadata? In Gilliland (2016), you saw the following definition in the table:

> Metadata related to how a system functions or metadata behaves
> 
> (Gilliland, 2016, section Categorizing Metadata)

Riley (2017) helps situate technical metadata by describing the purpose and then providing information about the uses for technical metadata. Again, technical metadata is a kind of administrative metadata, so it does not necessarily support end-user retrieval, but rather is there to help the database administrator ensure the system and its contents are working. 

**Table 1 Example Properties and Primary Uses for Technical Metadata** **(Riley, 2017, p. 7)**

#### **Metadata Type**

#### **Example Properties**

#### **Primary Uses**

Technical metadata

File type

File size

Creation date/time

Compression scheme

Interoperability

Digital object management

Preservation

**Key Ideas in IO: The One-to-One Principle**
---------------------------------------------

This technical metadata has the potential to help support the one-to-one principle (also written 1:1 principle) in digital libraries. The following is the first part of the abstract for a paper from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) conference by Steven J. Miller, a well-respected and well-known digital librarian. In it, Miller explains the one-to-one principle. 

#### The One-To-One Principle: Challenges in Current Practice

_Steven J. Miller_

##### **Abstract**

The DCMI One-to-One Principle holds that related but conceptually different entities, such as a photograph and a digital image of that photograph, should be represented by separate metadata records.

\*\*\*

This is an important principle, simply because a photograph of an artifact that might be searched in a repository, for example, has a completely separate date of creation from the date of creation of the artifact.

Stop and think about that for a minute.

The terra cotta urn was from 2000 BCE, but the photo in the database was taken in 2012—the photo has a certain resolution, file type, color palette, compression scheme, etc.

Information about _both_ is necessary for the database administrator—the end-user, however, only cares about the urn (the physical object).

**Examples of Technical Metadata**
----------------------------------

Riley (2017) describes properties and uses for technical metadata in Table 1, and in "Setting the Stage," Gilliland (2016) gives examples. These examples of technical metadata are, unsurprisingly, a bit technical in nature:

> *   Hardware and software documentation
> *   System-generated procedural information (e.g., routing and event metadata)
> *   Technical digitization information (e.g., formats, compression ratios, scaling routines)
> *   Tracking of system-response times
> *   Authentication and security data (e.g., encryption keys, passwords)
> 
> (Gilliland, 2016, section Categorizing Metadata)

Take a moment to look some of these up if you are curious to know more.
