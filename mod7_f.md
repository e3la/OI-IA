"Recommended Formats Statements" (LOC, 2020)
============================================

The Library of Congress site, "Recommended Formats Statements," will help you appreciate the complexity of the information that may be included in technical metadata.

> [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/)Â 

#### Notes

*   Browse through a few of the pages for different types of formats.
*   See the menu near the top that lists format types (e.g., Textual Works).
*   Not only is the information presented here complex, some of the pages point users to additional resources to be consulted in describing that format.

#### **Next**

_Another kind of administrative metadata, preservation metadata, will be explored._
