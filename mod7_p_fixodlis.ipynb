        "*   Some metadata is created automatically, some manually.\r\n",
        "*   Some metadata is used behind the scenes and some is exposed for user by users.\r\n",

Most of the descriptive metadata used in the information professions is created manually, and most of the technical metadata is created automatically. On the web, most everything is done automatically. In digital libraries and digital archives, a mix of the two environments might be found. \r\n",

Other metadata might be created later. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) is usually run over a file after the image is created. OCR enables the text of the file to be searchable. Compare the following two documents: one is basically a digital photo of a document, the other is the same file, but has had OCR and has corrected the text and made it searchable.\r\n",
