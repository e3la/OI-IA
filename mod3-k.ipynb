Ultimately, in libraries, this is the work that information professionals carry out in cataloging. There are two main aspects to cataloging: Descriptive cataloging and subject cataloging. \r\n","\r\n","**Descriptive Cataloging**\r\n","--------------------------\r\n","\r\n","In the above diagram, to the left is the work the information intermediary does that relates to the physical container (e.g., the book itself) and what is written there. Think back to the catalog records in MERLIN you just examined. Much of the information there described the books based on what the book looked like (e.g., number of pages, if there are illustrations, if there is an index) and the words written on the book (e.g., the name of the author, the title of the book, the name of the publisher, etc.)\r\n","\r\n","This is [descriptive cataloging](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descripcatalog), defined in the ODLIS as: \r\n","\r\n","> [**descriptive cataloging**](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descripcatalog)  \r\n","> The part of the [library](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) [cataloging](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloging) process concerned with identifying and describing the physical and bibliographic characteristics of the [item](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem), and with determining the name(s) and [title](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title)(s) to be used as [access point](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accesspoint)s in the [catalog](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog), but not with the assignment of [subject heading](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading)s and [genre/form term](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#genreformterm)s.

Both of these tasks are mentioned in the definition in the ODLIS. Nonetheless, looking specifically at each makes sense. \r\n","\r\n","#### Description\r\n","\r\n","With _description_, the cataloger will describe the physical or electronic container that houses the intellectual content. Is this a book with 280 pages? A PDF? A streaming audio file? How does the title appear on the resource? How is the publisher's name written? What date was this published? If you have the physical item in your hand, you can answer these questions and record or transcribe the data. \r\n","\r\n","#### Access\r\n","\r\n","Information intermediaries also create access points in the bibliographic record based on what they see written on the resource. [Access points](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accesspoint) are highly structured content provided in specific fields of the bibliographic record that allow for really high-quality search. \r\n","\r\n","Access points can include the form of a person's name as established by catalogers. Did you ever wonder how those last-name-first forms of names found their way into library catalogs?
