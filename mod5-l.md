#### General Topic of Metadata

> Coyle, K. (2010). Library data in a modern context. _Library Technology Reports_, _46_(1), 5–13. Retrieved from [https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/4630/5478](https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/%0b4630/5478)

##### Notes

*   This is another useful overview of metadata, and is a good complement to the Riley reading.
*   Karen Coyle maintains a blog—Coyle's information—and many of her writings challenge our current direction with metadata. She has argued for years that we need to ensure that our metadata can be used on the web. She is an informed writer who understands the technology as well as the metadata.

#### History of Descriptive Cataloging

> Joint Steering Committee for the Development of RDA. (2009). A brief history of AACR. [http://rda-jsc.org/archivedsite/history.html](http://rda-jsc.org/archivedsite/history.html) 

##### Notes

*   This page is located in an archived site.
*   The standards body that devised the current descriptive standards for library cataloging, RDA (_Resource Description and Access_) compiled this list of cataloging standards used in the Anglo-American tradition (i.e., in the U.K. and U.S.)
*   Note the entries at the beginning go back to Panizzi and Cutter, two of the actors mentioned in Module 4, in the part about key players in Western traditions. 
*   The remainder of the entries are equally compelling, and essential to understanding IO in modern librarianship's evolution.

#### Practical Instruction on Library Cataloging

> Fay, Robin. (2015). Cataloging basics. SEFLIN Training Basics.
