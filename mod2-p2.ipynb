It is much more technical!\n","*   From this perspective, components of an information retrieval system include tiered indexes, query-term proximation, and designing, parsing and scoring functions.\n","\n","* * *\n","\n","#### **Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency**\n","\n","Relating to retrieval algorithms supporting relevance, one of the essential notions is that of term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF). What does this mean?\n","\n","In a set of documents (like a database—ERIC, for instance), an algorithm can be trained to identify documents based on the the full text (not the metadata) and the uniqueness of the words. Any document in English will contain the word \"the\"—but if a document contains the word \"cats\" 15 times, and is the only document out of 100 documents to contain the word \"cats\" the frequency in the document is high, compared to the frequency in the other documents, which is low (zero, in this case) so that document is the most relevant to the query \"cats.\"\n","\n","#### Notes\n","\n","*   See this website for some additional information about TF/IDF: [http://www.tfidf.com/](http://www.tfidf.com/)\n","*   For more specifics, including how to calculate, along with a nice bibliography of IR texts of interest: [http://www.tfidf.com/](http://www.tfidf.com/)\n","\n","* * *\n","\n","> Philbin, C.A.
