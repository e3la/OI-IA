Information seekers rely on the work of information intermediaries to find information resources.\n","\n","![Users-Systems-Resources flow chart](mod5-components-info-retrieval.png)\n","\n","This view is simplified, but can help us to visualize where IO fits into a number of information agencies. To break this down, consider the following aspects of information retrieval:\n","\n","| Information Seekers   |      Retrieval Systems      |  Information Resources |\n","|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n","|People: users (aka customers, patrons, clients)<br><br>   Machines: automated systems (e.g., Google) may seek information curated by libraries | Retrieval systems provided by libraries (catalogs, subject guides, finding aids, discovery systems, etc.)<br><br>Search engines<br><br>Librarians and archivists (classroom instruction, reference desk, consultations)<br><br>Library guides (including online LibGuides, bibliographies, etc.)<br><br>And more … (friends can help information seekers, etc.) | Journals, articles, books, magazines, videos, etc.<br><br>Manuscripts, paintings, and other unique materials<br>Web content |\n","\n","\n","**Information Retrieval, Revisited**\n","------------------------------------\n","\n","In the last Module, information retrieval was explored. As stated previously, information retrieval is the act of searching for known items in a catalog, index or database. Some retrieval tools are analog, and some are digital. Computer-based information storage and retrieval systems, such as a librarie's OPAC (online public access catalog) are designed for convience and effectiveness balanced with speed, accuracy and cost. \n","\n","Throughout Module 2, the actof information retrieval and its key components were explored.\n","\n","As the focus turns to information agencies and their users, this definition can be revisited. First, this definition clarifies that information retrieval in information settings is primarily used to support: \n","\n","1.  **[known item](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_jk.aspx#knownitem)  searches**, and \n","2.  specific **[subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject) searches.** \n","\n","If you are unfamiliar with these terms, be sure to follow the links above. What this means is that information systems, in libraries, especially, are geared toward users who already know what they want—either a specific book, for example, or items on a specific subject.\n","\n","This is a HUGE assumption! While the assumptions may help system designers stay focused, that may also impose limitations on the functionality of retrieval systems and limit users in their discovery of resources that meet their broad information needs. \n","\n","The readings that follow will cover organization in LAMs in different ways. Understanding these different environments supports a global understanding of the problems that IO addresses. As you read and explore the topics, consider the ways the retrieval systems mentioned and/or with which you are familiar help and hinder the information retrieval process. \n","\n","```{admonition} Review from Module 2\n","In libraries, users will consult very specific kinds of resources designed to organize a library's content, such as: \n","\n","*   print-based [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog), which has given way to the [online catalog ](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#onlinecatalog)in the electronic age\n","*   print-based  [index](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#index), which have matured into the online [bibliographic database](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdatabase)\n","\n","THESE are the primary retrieval systems used in libraries. This list is not exclusive. There are other systems and tools that will point people to information resources, such as subject guides (e.g., LibGuides) and finding aids. There are also systems that serve as both repositories of information resources and retrieval tools for those resources, such as digital libraries and institutional repositories.\n","\n","Each of these may or may not play a role in information retrieval in different kinds of LAMs.\n","```\n","\n","```{admonition} Coming Soon!\n","In the rest of this Module, you will look at:\n","\n","*   library catalogs\n","*   users of retrieval systems and tools\n","*   principles governing cataloging\n","*   key ideas in IO\n","*   the application of some of these ideas in archives and museums\n","```\n","\n","#### **Next**\n","\n","_The next page presents an opportunity for self study, allowing you to take what you learned in Module 2 and begin applying it to the question of user need and the information resources LAMs provide._"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PVr-E9P1uhsk"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
