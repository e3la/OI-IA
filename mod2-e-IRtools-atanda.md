# "Information Retrieval Tools: Catholicon to Accessing Library Resources" (Atanda & Adeyemi, 2018).

Retrieval tools may all have developed from print-based systems, but today, many retrieval tools have evolved to function more efficiently in computerized environments.

> Atanda, L. A., & Adeyemi, S. A. (2018). Information retrieval tools: Catholicon to accessing library resources. _Research Journal of Library and Information Science, 2_(2), 30â€“35. [https://www.sryahwapublications.com/research-journal-of-library-and-information-science/pdf/v2-i2/4.pdf](https://www.sryahwapublications.com/research-journal-of-library-and-information-science/pdf/v2-i2/4.pdf)

#### Notes

*   From an international, open access journal, which provides a view and an understanding that these issues are not unique to libraries in the United States or North America. (Do not let grammatical errors in the article deter your reading.)
*   This is a quick read that will serve as a review of topics covered so far. Useful in that it covers, "the information retrieval problem."
*   Of note:
    *   "The explosive growth of information has made it a matter of survival for companies to have at their disposal good information retrieval tools. " (p. 31)
*   Describes these "major tools": Catalogues, Classification Schemes, Indexes, Abstracts, Bibliographies. (Note: The description of Abstracts ended up as the abstract for the article, rather than with the description of the other tools on pages 32-34.) As you read, consider the place of each of these tools in the retrieval of information resources today.

#### **Next**

_Considering the importance of technology to the organization of information and information retrieval, the next page considers the beginning of the digital era in organization and retrieval -- a time when online systems were decidedly user-unfriendly. Librarians and programmers were the only ones with the knowledge to search in a number of systems. You will want to keep in mind why and how these systems were designed as a way to understand just how far retrieval (and organization) has come._
