**Rationale**

In order to study the organization of information, we need a shared understanding of what exactly we're organizing. In Module 1, we start off thinking about information in different ways, focusing on library and information science (LIS) perspectives, and then we start integrating ideas about the organization of information that will be used throughout the course.
