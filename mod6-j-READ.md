"Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories" (Glushko et al., 2016)—TDO Chapter 8
========================================================================================

To begin thinking about classification in action formally, take a look at the chapter in the Glushko book on classification.

> Glushko, R. J., Hemerly, J., Petras, V.,  Manoochehri, M., Wang, L., Shedlock, J.. & Griffin, D. (2016). Classification: Assigning resources to categories. In R. J. Glushko (Ed.), _The discipline of organizing_ (4th ed., Professional ed., pp. 417–466). MIT Press. [https://ischools.org/resources/Documents/Discipline%20of%20organizing/Professional/TDO4-Prof-CC-Chapter8.pdf](https://ischools.org/resources/Documents/Discipline%20of%20organizing/Professional/TDO4-Prof-CC-Chapter8.pdf)

#### Notes

*   This chapter in Glushko's OER provides an outstanding overview of what it is to classify in general, and also in the information professions.
*   Some parts of this chapter might be a little challenging, and that is alright. Use the online sources you know (e.g., Wikipedia, the ODLIS, etc.) to understand broadly the ideas. 
    *   There is no need to understand _every_ detail—go for an overall grasp of the concepts
*   Be sure to self-assess by reading through 8.7 Key Points in Chapter Eight.

#### **Next**

_The next two pages present information on two classification systems that are heavily used in libraries in the United States: Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification (LCC)._
