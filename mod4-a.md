# Welcome to Module 4. Historical Approaches to IO

## Historical Approaches to IO

In the first module, the readings (especially Buckland, 1991) demonstrated that information is a tricky concept to define. Nonetheless, information professionals have been working with information for millennia. Acquisition and organization or library resources are the pillars of library science, and the basis of all work carried out in the information professions. Strategies for organizing that information have developed and been perfected over time, and as information resources have adapted and evolved, and as users and their information needs have changed, organization has adapted and evolved. Methods of retrieval have grown around these changes, also.

In this module, we look at some of the history that directly supports the evolution of practices in North America. This is principally from a Western point of view. If you are interested in other approaches and traditions (and the authors of this OER hope that you are), additional sources are provide to get you started.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After completing this module, you will be able to:

*   Describe the historical trajectory in Western traditions of written information and the professional efforts to organize materials over time, including pivotal advances.
*   Identify key developments, people, and agencies (including standards bodies) that have impacted IO in Western traditions.
*   Integrate additional ideas about organizing information, particularly in practice, with broader notions and examples of IO introduced in previous Modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Based on the historical trajectory you read about and the key players you are studying, what overarching trends can you identify?
*   Given the trajectory of IO throughout history, how might technology be used going forward to advance the information professions?

**Rationale**
-------------

If organization of information is a pillar of librarianship, then learning about its evolution through recorded history is an important step to understanding the field today. Much of the investigation in this module focuses on Western approaches, but you should remember that other approaches have existed throughout time in other traditions and cultures and continue to exist today.
