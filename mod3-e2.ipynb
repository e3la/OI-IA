But, what is the point of a catalog, anyway?\r\n","\r\n","**The Functions of Catalogs**\r\n","-----------------------------\r\n","\r\n","The primary functions of library catalogs are to help users, both a community of users and information professionals, search the collection for a known item or for items by subject. In this case, the user already knows the name of the author and/or the title of the item, or has identified a topic of interest. In their searches, users hope to bring together everything in the collections based on the search (i.e., to collocate based on author, title, or topic), and then to evaluate what they find. You will find these ideas presented below.\r\n","\r\n","A modern formal definition of [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx) can be found on the ODLIS.\r\n","\r\n","### **Charles Ammi Cutter**\r\n","\r\n","Charles Ammi Cutter's name will appear several times throughout this class.
