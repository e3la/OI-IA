But how did standards come to play such a major role in organization?\r\n","\r\n","Standards are often formalized versions of efforts that began locally. When something works well, word gets around, and others want to do the same time. For example, consider the ODLIS's definition of [best practices](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bestpractices):\r\n","\r\n","> **best practices**  \r\n","> In the application of theory to real-life situations, procedures that, when properly applied, consistently yield superior results and are therefore used as reference points in evaluating the effectiveness of alternative methods of accomplishing the same task. Best practices are identified by examining empirical evidence of success. See, for example, the [guideline](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#guidelines) of the [Association of College and Research Libraries](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#acrl) (ACRL) on [_Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate Best Practices_](http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/characteristics.cfm) (2003). Compare with [guidelines](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#guidelines) and [standards](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#standards).\r\n","\r\n","Best practices are closely related to guidelines. Why? Because they often share the same origins. As best practices become more codified and are picked up by different groups, they become guidelines. The definition of [guidelines](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#guidelines) in the ODLIS is the following:\r\n","\r\n","> **guidelines**  \r\n","> Recommended procedures for accomplishing a given task or achieving a set of [goals](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#goal) and [objectives](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#objective), formulated by a body with authority to speak on the subject but less binding than the formal [standards](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#standards) used in evaluation and assessment, for example, [_Guidelines Regarding Thefts in Libraries_](http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=Preservation&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=8904) approved in 2003 by the [Association of College and Research Libraries](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#acrl) (ACRL) and the [American Library Association](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#ala) (ALA). Compare with [best practices](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bestpractices).\r\n","\r\n","As key players in organization put forth their ideas for best practices, those best practices were slowly adopted by information professionals around the world when they were picked up as guidelines. Eventually, they were codified as standards.\r\n","\r\n","**What Are Standards?**\r\n","-----------------------\r\n","\r\n","With many standards, practices start locally and then expand. All around us in our everyday lives, things as simple as plugging in our phones to charge them requires the use of standardized plugs, the electrical outlets themselves, the voltage running through those outlets, the type of current, etc.\r\n","\r\n","There are so many standards, many of which can be taken for granted. For example:\r\n","\r\n","*   Fahrenheit vs. Celsius temperature scales\r\n","*   QWERTY vs. AZERTY keyboards\r\n","*   Betamax vs. VHS\r\n","*   Electrical outlets (see Figure 1) and voltage\r\n","\r\n","The list goes on and on and on. What exactly are standards? \r\n","\r\n","**Figure 1 Electrical Outlets and Flags of Countries/Territories in Which They Are Used**![International Electrical Outlets -- Complete Electrical Solutions](http://completeelectrical.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Outlets.jpg)\r\n","\r\n","_Note_.

For example, the retrieval tools used require standards to be searchable (technology can be somewhat unforgiving when things are not encoded correctly). If all information professionals carrying out a certain task, use the same approaches and standards, their work will be interchangeable. This means if catalog records are shared, for example, then only the first library to receive a book will need to catalog it—the rest will just use a copy of that same record. In an increasingly networked world, benefits to information encoded in the same way means that entire systems of information can be shared and used. The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is a great example: [https://dp.la/ ](https://dp.la/)\r\n","\r\n","![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633278/download)  \r\n","DPLA is an interface that serves as a gateway to contents housed in local libraries, all of which have encoded their content in a way that allows for search through DPLA.
