        "=================================\n",
        "\n",
        "Surrogate records in libraries describe information resources and include such information as author names, titles, summaries, publishers, etc. Publisher websites include some of the same information for the information resources they are offering for sale. Digital libraries include similar information, plus digital versions of content. Information on authors can be found on author websites, Wikipedia, and on genealogical and biographical websites. Reviews of the information resources can be found on various sites, too. So, much of the information is duplicated on various sites. How can we make use of information stored in various databases and websites?\n",
        "\n",
        "The linking features of the internet and linked data technologies provide opportunities to share data with other sites and to make use of data published elsewhere. Linked data is an emerging technology for encoding data and has the possibility of upending the way content is stored, displayed, and made searchable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technology is changing quickly, and with these advances come new opportunities for cultural heritage agencies to tap into emerging web-based standards.\n",

        "Linked open data will permit libraries, archives, and museums to create connections and to show relationships that other technologies (like MARC) simply cannot accommodate. A number of initiatives are underway and will, in the future, change the way our retrieval tools work."
