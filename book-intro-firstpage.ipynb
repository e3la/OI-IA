Core courses typically are taken as classes at the beginning of your program of study, generally completed before most elective courses. Accordingly, this course material is introductory in nature, with the goal of setting students up for understanding the field of organization of information (IO) which might be very new to them. It also should help provide perspective on how IO is related to most other work carried out in the information professions.\n","\n","IO is a field with a lot of precise terminology. Some call it _jargon_ or _professional jargon_, others call it_ terms of art_.\n","\n","Tips:\n","\n","\n","\n","*   Develop the practice of reading so as to understand terms (especially ones that might be _professional jargon_) that are new to you. If you do not understand a term, take the time look it up.\n","*   Remember that terms used in LIS (library and information science) may be defined differently in other disciplines. Be careful of the definition you accept.\n","*   Read actively! Take your own notes. Look things up. Explore research in the area. Look into examples from practice. Re-read anything that remains unclear.\n","\n","![CC BY NC SA](Ccby-nc-sa_icon.png)\n","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","## Abstract\n","\n","Investigate the \"behind the scenes\" work of making information resources available, especially in online environments supported by information agencies and cultural heritage institutions.
