    "There's no quiz on this and you do not have to submit what you came up with (though you can!). The point is to think really deeply about information at the beginning of the semester, before we get too far in. Why? Because _information_ is what we're organizing, so we need to know what that is before we can continue.\n",

    "To help pin down what we mean by \"information,\" based on your knowledge of libraries, archives, and museums, identify one or two examples of things that might be collected in each of the following: a large research library (e.g., electronic access to a scholarly journal); a rural public library (e.g., a paperback novel); an archives (e.g., a handwritten manuscript); and a museum (e.g., a necklace from Imperial Russia).\n",

    "Now, reflect on what is similar and what is different about each of these things. In what ways is each _information_? Is there a special or specialized user group for each? Could there be more than one user group? What background will the user group(s) have to have in order to get the most of the thing (e.g., specialized knowledge of a field), or is some basic interest in the item enough to begin learning. What about things that are for enjoyment, like the novel? Or arguably for some, the necklace?\n",
