It is quite another to figure out a system for making the actual items retrievable in a physical space like a library.\r\n","\r\n","Organizing materials in a library can be done based on various features of the information resources. Some possibilities include the following:\r\n","\r\n","*   Sometimes items are given an accession number when they are added to a collection.

(classify, v.) ~ 1. The organization of materials into categories according to a scheme that identifies, distinguishes, and relates the categories. - 2. The process of assigning materials a code or heading indicating a category to which it belongs; see code. - 3. The process of assigning restrictions to materials, limiting access to specific individuals, especially for purposes of national security; security classification.\r\n","> \r\n","> **Notes:**\r\n","> \r\n","> Classification may involve physically arranging the materials or use of a class code to index and retrieve documents stored in a different order. For electronic documents, classification may involve assigning a class code used to index and retrieve the document. In some schemes, documents may be assigned to more than one class. - Classification2 in libraries refers to the process of assigning a Dewey, Library of Congress, or other code to indicate where a book is to be shelved.\r\n","\r\n","Classification numbers are the basis of call numbers.
