# Self Study: Identifying Useful Metadata

![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633222/preview)  
Use a book in your collection or one that is at hand. A non-fiction book will work better for this exercise. Use the timer and explore the book, keeping in mind the types of information included in surrogate records in library catalogs. Write down the information you would include in a surrogate record. You will need it for the next exercise.

Consider the following:

> *   What information printed on or in the book will be useful to a person reading the surrogate record in a library catalog? Examine the front and back of the book and the pages at the beginning and end of the book. Note where different pieces of information are found.
> *   Next, consider information that you can derive from examining the book, such as whether it is illustrated and how large it is. What additional information might be useful to a library user?
> *   Which information is core or essential to the description of the item?
> *   Does the information your provide presume a particular type of user?Â 

This is a deceptively challenging question! Moreover, there is no one, single answer.

#### **Next**

_Next, revisit the five user tasks previously presented._
