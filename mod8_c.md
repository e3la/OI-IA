"The Organizing System Roadmap" (Glushko, 2016)—TDO Chapter 11
==============================================================

Before proceeding to more details on online catalogs, read this chapter about the broader topic of organizing systems.

> Glushko, R. J. (2016). The organizing system roadmap. In R. J. Glushko (Ed.), _The discipline of organizing_ (4th ed., Professional ed., pp. 559-586). MIT Press. [https://ischools.org/resources/Documents/Discipline%20of%20organizing/Professional/TDO4-Prof-CC-Chapter11.pdf](https://ischools.org/resources/Documents/Discipline%20of%20organizing/Professional/TDO4-Prof-CC-Chapter11.pdf)

#### Notes

*   This chapter "summarizes the design issues and choices that emerge during an organizing system's lifecycle." (pp. 559–560)
*   Though not exclusively focused on library catalogs, the points are applicable to the design of a library catalog.
*   11.7 may be a good place to start, as it covers key points and give you an overview.
*   11.3. See the five interrelated aspects of an organizing system.
*   11.4. Identifying requirements for an organizing system.
*   11.5.3 Distinguishing access from control.

#### **Next**

_The systems described in TDO organize a variety of kinds of content. Specifically, however, what do library catalogs organize? The next page checks in with information about content you might have know passively, providing a quick overview of what library catalog surrogate records typically describe._
