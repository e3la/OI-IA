In the United States, the Library of Congress is one of those organizations, along with NARA.\r\n","\r\n","#### National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\r\n","\r\n","NARA ([https://www.archives.gov/](https://www.archives.gov/)) is the National Archives of the United States. Other archives exist (including [presidential libraries](https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries) which are often a cross between libraries, archives, and museums), but this is the official one for the government. Since e-government has become a mandate, NARA has been even busier.\r\n","\r\n","*   Learn more about the work of NARA: [https://www.archives.gov/about](https://www.archives.gov/about)\r\n","*   National Association of Government Archives and Records Administrators (NAGARA) ([https://www.nagara.org/)](https://www.nagara.org/)\r\n","\r\n","#### Library of Congress Standards ([https://www.loc.gov/librarians/standards](https://www.loc.gov/librarians/standards))\r\n","\r\n","One of the many standards maintained by the Library of Congress is the **Encoded Archival Description (EAD)** standard ([https://www.loc.gov/ead/](https://www.loc.gov/ead/)).\r\n","\r\n","**Q: What is EAD and what does it do?**\r\n","\r\n","A: Briefly, it is a standard that allows archivists to encode information about their collections—specifically, _finding aids_—in a consistent way.\r\n","\r\n","**Q: What's a finding aid?**\r\n","\r\n","A: LC describes them here: [https://www.loc.gov/rr/ead/](https://www.loc.gov/rr/ead/)\r\n","\r\n","**Q: Why would archivists or other information professionals want to adhere to standards like this?**\r\n","\r\n","A: There are a number of reasons, including 1) being able to use commercial products to support access, 2) having users learn once at one place about using the standard, and being able to use all digital archives websites equally, and 3) allowing their collections to integrate seamlessly with others using the standard.\r\n","\r\n","**Q: What does an encoded finding aid look like?**\r\n","\r\n","A: Find out for yourself!

Do information professionals accept top-down approaches to being told how to do a thing? What does \"standard\" even mean, and how do they evolve?
