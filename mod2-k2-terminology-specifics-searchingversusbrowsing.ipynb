IO and IR have a very precise terminology for how users interact with these tools.\n","\n","Unfortunately, these terms may be used in everyday language and in interactions with retrieval tools is a less precise and slightly different way.\n","\n","This means that, as an information professional, you need to be \"bilingual\"—you need to understand how these terms are used in IO/IR, but also understand that your users and clients will probably mean different things when they use these terms. One of the challenges of the information professions is to act as a go-between.\n","\n","## Search Query\n","\n","A search query is what a user inputs in the search box to find results.  Search queries are performed in online catalogs and other bibliographic databases by users who hope to find records relevant to their information needs. The search query is often made up of search terms, words and phrases, used alone or in combination, may be supplied by patrons or related terms discovered in the results of a search. \n","\n","The search software, computer program, or digital interface designed to execute a search for information when queried by a user, is generally designed to be user-friendly and often provide both a 'simple search' interface and an advanced search interface.\n","\n","Librarians are often better at searching for information because they can utilize boolean logic, truncation, wildcar and proximity operators in search tools. Different databases have differ sorts of advanced capabilities. Sometimes they are documented in help information, and sometimes they are not. As a librarian using these advanced capabilities can make you invaluable when helping patrons. \n","\n","Search terms in combination with other strategies can provide a search statement. A search statement occurs in information retrieval when search terms are used in combination with advanced search techniques.\n","\n","Sometimes a query can include more than just words, though. Often, to yield more precise results, specific indexes are searched (e.g., the search term only appears in the title) or the results are limited in some way (e.g., to a certain date range).  \n","\n","All told, even though the term \"search\" can show up in a number of places in everyday language (from searching for your keys, to Madonna's [I Don't Search, I Find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don't_Search_I_Find)), IO (and IR) mean something very precise. Will you be surprised to learn that the term _browse_ is no different in that regard? \n","\n","## Browse\n","\n","In many libraries when you walk through the stacks (the shelves of books) you'll find similar books grouped together. Books are assigned call numbers as they relate to their subjects. You browse the stacks as a tangible experience, or digitally browse library catalogs and similar databases, when you explore results without clearly defined intentions. Standardized record formats on digital databases can allow users to scan headings, and follow various points of access (such as linked author or subject headings) with ease.\n","\n","Browsing is also the term used for casualy searching the web. allowing serendipty to guide us from link to link (such links are core to the nature of hypertext & the World Wide Web).\n","\n","_Browse_ can be used interchangeably with _search_ to mean _look for_ in any number of contexts. This is a great natural language use of this term, and is probably the kind of terminology most users will employ. \n","\n","In an IO/IR context, browse is what a user does after entering the search query in an interface that allows for further navigation or exploration. This is, again, within the context of IR, so search software has been used to launch a query in a retrieval tool (probably a database of some kind).\n","\n","To explore hyperlinks on the world wide web is the type of _browse_ most users mean when talking about their interactions with the Web. It's similar to the IR meaning of the term, but the Web isn't a retrieval tool in the same way a museum catalog is, for example, so the browsing capabilities are different. \n","\n","#### **Next**\n","\n","_The next page will help you get more of a handle on what is meant by \"browse\" in the information professions from the IO/IR perspective._"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xYpjQNjeu4Gz"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
