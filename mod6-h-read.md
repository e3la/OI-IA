"Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies" (2010)
=======================================================================================================

What were the features of thesauri you saw in the records in the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (and also in the library's subject heading on the preceding page)?

In fact, these are the mechanisms that make thesauri work (see Figure 1). They are required—a controlled vocabulary is not considered  a "thesaurus" if it does not have certain characteristics. (You will notice that LCSH has many of these same characteristics, but LCSH calls itself a subject heading list—mostly because some aspects required for a thesaurus are nonetheless missing or are inconsistently supplied).

Read the following document—focus especially on the definitions in section 4 (you need  to grasp more than a few of these), section 5, section 6, and section 8.

#### Notes

*   This might seem like a dry read until you realize that these instructions outline what you will do for your Thesaurus Assignment in this class!
*   As you read this, think about the ERIC thesaurus available through the ERIC database, and how you as a user can better understand it.
*   Also, reflect on how to explain what you are learning to non-professional users. Sometimes, students like to try explaining these concepts to family and friends as practice.

_Verbal subject access was only one way of carrying out "subject cataloging." The other way discussed is the application of classification schemes._
