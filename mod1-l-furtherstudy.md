# Module 1. For Further Study

 **![recommend-icon](recommend-icon.png) For Further Study**

Why do we organize? These two easy-to-read articles (blog posts) address this question.

> Brodkin, J. (2007, January 23). You are wasting time; find out why. _Network World._ [https://www.networkworld.com/article/2303260/you-are-wasting-time--find-out-why.html (Links to an external site.)](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2303260/you-are-wasting-time--find-out-why.html)

#### Notes

*   Think of all the wasted time that goes into searching!
*   Consider this block quote, taken from the beginning of the article:

> "A company that employs 1,000 information workers can expect more than $5 million in annual salary costs to go down the drain because of the time wasted looking for information and not finding it IDC research found last year." (para. 1)

> Murphy, B. (2019, September 20). Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma and Susan Wojcicki All Made This Top 10 List. Can You Guess Who Else Is On It? _Inc._Â  [https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-jack-ma-susan-wojcicki-all-made-this-top-10-list-can-you-guess-who-else-is-on-it.html (Links to an external site.)](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-jack-ma-susan-wojcicki-all-made-this-top-10-list-can-you-guess-who-else-is-on-it.html)

#### Notes

*   How do people process information? And how do they want to?

> "Human beings are inundated with information. We respond when it's organized, coupled with a promise of digestible authority" (para. 15).

```python
