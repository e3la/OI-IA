Self-Study: Library Catalog Deeper Dive
=======================================

So far, this Module has described a number of objects and principles guiding library catalogs. What, however, IS a library catalog?

According to part of the ODLIS entry for [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog):

> **catalog**  
> A [comprehensive](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#comprehensive) list of the [books](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#book), [periodicals](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#periodical), [maps](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#map), and other [materials](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libmaterials) in a given [collection](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libcollec), arranged in systematic order to facilitate [retrieval](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#inforetrieval) (usually [alphabetically](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#alphabetical) by [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title), and/or [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject)). In most modern [libraries](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library), the [card catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cardcatalog) has been [converted](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#retrocon) to [machine-readable](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#machinereadable) [bibliographic records](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord) and is available [online](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#online). 

Looking more closely at this description:

*   The catalog is a **list** of resources held in the collections. 
*   The catalog facilitates **retrieval**. It may be a card catalog (see photographs in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog)) or it may be an online catalog. Or, it could be in book form (see example in [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/432953466)).
*   The catalog includes **bibliographic records**, also known as _surrogate records_, _catalog records_, or _metadata_.

Bibliographic records provide intellectual access to library resources. The descriptive information in the record gives users information about the library resource (title, author, publisher, etc.) and about the content of the resource (summary, subjects, tables of contents, etc.). This is the _surrogate_ function of the bibliographic record.

### ![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/45003/files/7748340/download)  
**Note**

**The library catalog does not include the actual item sought by library users.**

The bibliographic records in catalogs serve as _surrogates_ for the actual books, sound recordings, etc. Bibliographic records include information to inform users about the resources and then point users to the resources themselves. 

*   You might remember the discussion of surrogates, which are particular kinds of records.
*   Surrogate = substitute (Merriam-Webster, [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surrogate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surrogate)).
*   The surrogate is a substitute for the actual library resource.

**What Makes for a Successful Library Catalog?**
------------------------------------------------

Although specifics of what, and how library catalogs might be measured or assessed are still open to discussion, a few basic elements are the following:

#### Good Metadata

*   Compare these two records in MERLIN, the catalog for the University of Missouri. Which will best meet Cutter's objects and the IFLA principles?
    *   [http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b12432732~S8 ](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b12432732~S8)
    *   [http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b12986930~S8](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b12986930~S8)

#### Good Database Search Engine

*   Browse and search functions, with a good database search engine.
    *   MERLIN: [http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/search/X](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/search/X)
    *   On the opening screen in MERLIN, you can
        *   Browse by different types of information: Titles, Journal titles, and Authors.
        *   Perform a keyword search.
*   In addition to searching, many catalogs provide options to filter or limit search results.

#### Useful Display of Results

*   Review the following results set and note whether the information displayed will be comprehensive enough to assist a user in proceeding to the next step: selecting an item that might meet the user's needs.
*   [http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/search~S8/X?SEARCH=(redress)&searchscope=8](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/search~S8/X?SEARCH=(redress)&searchscope=8)

#### Useful Display of Bibliographic Records

*   In the following record in MERLIN, note whether the information is organized in a way that is easy to understand and whether the field labels will be useful to most users who, in this case, are members of a university community.
*   [http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b11839702~S8](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b11839702~S8)

![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/45003/files/7748332/download)  
Now, try it yourself! Use the 5-minute timer and take the time to search in MERLIN. In ERIC, you searched for Lady Gaga. Is there another term you prefer to search in an academic library catalog?

> *   Try a browse or keyword search in MERLIN: the search terms you use are up to you.
>     *   Be creative!
>     *   If you get stuck, you can always search the term "cats"â€¦
> *   When you get search results, test out the Modify or Limit functions.
> *   Evaluate the experience using the four criteria listed above.

These are some of the basic functions of an online catalog. Library catalogs will vary depending on the software platform used and local customization.

#### **Next**

_Library catalogs are certainly not the only retrieval systems used by information professionals, but they are some of the most well-known, and serve as a great point of departure. One important feature of retrieval systems is the ability to permit search based on the topic of the resource. Knowledge organization systems are one of the primary ways this takes place._
