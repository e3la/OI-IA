Key Ideas in IO: Cutter's Principle of User Convenience
=======================================================

Information professionals organize for usersâ€”to support the users' ability to find what they are looking for.

In the last page, the intellectual time and effort that go into cataloging were alluded to. When you think about it, it might easiest for all catalogers to do their own thing and include only information that is easy to provide, setting aside any difficult work.

> The convenience of the user must be put before the ease of the cataloger.
