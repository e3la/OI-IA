# Module 3. For Further Study

## For Further Study

Depending on how much time you have this week and your professional aspirations, you may want to look at one or more of the following:

> Mazzocchi, F. (2018). Knowledge organization system (KOS). _Knowledge Organization,_ _45_(1), 54-78. Also available in _ISKO Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization_, B. Hjørland & C. Gnoli (eds.), [https://www.isko.org/cyclo/kos](https://www.isko.org/cyclo/kos)

##### Notes

*   This article in _Knowledge Organization_ (republished in the online encyclopedia of ISKO), looks more closely at knowledge organization systems (KOSs).
*   Information agencies use KOSs extensively, but they generally are less used on the web.
*   What impact on access do you think KOS might or might not have for users of retail websites?

> Zeng, M. L. (2008). Knowledge organization systems (KOS). _Knowledge Organization, 35(_3/2), 160–182. [https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-160/knowledge-organization-systems-kos-jahrgang-35-2008-heft-2-3?hitid=3&search-click](https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-160/knowledge-organization-systems-kos-jahrgang-35-2008-heft-2-3?hitid=3&search-click)

##### Notes

*   This is another article from _Knowledge Organization_, by metadata expert Marcia Zeng.
*   This article is not also an entry in the encyclopedia, so its scope is slightly different from the previous one.

Excerpts from three online manuals that explain the value of organizing information resources, especially in museums:

> Information Management Team (IMT), Museum Management Program (MMP), National Center for Cultural Resources. (2000). Museum records. In _Museum handbook: Part II_. National Park Service, Museum Management Program. [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mushbkII.html](https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mushbkII.html)

##### Notes

    *   Cataloging Costs: [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mh2appb.pdf](https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mh2appb.pdf)

> Ericksen, H., Unger, I., & Museums Australia (Vic.). (2009). The small museums cataloguing manual: A guide to cataloguing object and image collections. Museums Australia Victoria. [https://amagavic.org.au/assets/Small\_Museums\_Cataloguing\_Manual\_4th.pdf](https://amagavic.org.au/assets/Small_Museums_Cataloguing_Manual_4th.pdf)

##### Notes

Excerpts from pages 11–13:

##### Why catalogue collections?

> Catalog records give you access to information about your museum collection for research and interpretation. They are also the primary property accountability records for museum objects. Catalog records tell you what objects you have, their condition, and where they're located. They provide physical and intellectual access to your museum collection.

##### Enriching cultural value

> Cataloguing underpins many important museum activities, including research, exhibition development, conservation, risk management, publication and outreach work, all of which are dependent on detailed and up-to-date collection information.

> Documenting an object enriches its intrinsic value. The accumulation of information gives an object meaning and context, and results in a stronger understanding of its uniqueness, its contribution to the collection and its reason for being collected in the first place.

> United States, Federal Depository Library Program. (2016). Bibliographic control. [https://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance-2/guidance/11-bibliographic-control](https://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance-2/guidance/11-bibliographic-control)

##### Notes

*   Bibliographic control for items in a depository collection has the greatest impact for users as it increases the exposure to and accessibility of primary resources on a wide variety of topics for information and research purposes.
*   **Classifying and Organizing Depository Material:** Arrangement of depository materials should conform to professionally accepted library standards. The arrangement should facilitate the practical use and access to the depository collection.
