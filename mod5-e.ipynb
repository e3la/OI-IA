I would venture to expand on her financial metaphor and say that **metadata is one of our most important assets**. Hardware and software come and go—sometimes becoming obsolete with alarming rapidity—but high-quality, standards-based, system-independent metadata can be used, reused, migrated, and disseminated in any number of ways, even in ways that we cannot anticipate at this moment (as in the case of linked open data, which is a relatively recent concept).\r\n","\r\n","#### Notes\r\n","\r\n","*   This chapter covers the use of metadata in libraries, archives, and museums. \r\n","*   See Table 1.
