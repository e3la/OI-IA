    "You may be very familiar with Amazon or other websites that sell merchandise online, and possibly less familiar with LIS databases. Either way, take five minutes to visit the [ERIC (Educational Resources Information Clearinghouse) (Links to an external site.)](https://eric.ed.gov/) online database of articles about education.\n",

    "*   What does each snippet tell you? Look carefully! There is a lot of information.\n",
    "*   What fields did the system search to come up with this set of results?\n",

    "_The structures of databases contribute a lot to how information can be retrieved. Buckland (1991) demonstrated that it is information-as-thing that information professionals are organizing and making available to users. In the case of library catalogs in particular and also databases like ERIC, the information being stored in the retrieval tool \"stands in\" for a book or an article. The special function of \"standing in for\" is important for information intermediaries._"
