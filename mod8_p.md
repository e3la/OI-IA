#### International Perspectives on Library Catalogs as Systems

> Bianchini, C. (2017). "It works like Google, right?": First survey on the user-catalog interaction in the library of the Department of Musicology and Cultural hHeritage (Cremona) of Pavia University. _AIB Studi, 57_(1), [https://doi.org/10.2426/aibstudi-11557](https://doi.org/10.2426/aibstudi-11557)

##### Notes

*   No surprises, but still interesting: "Results show that users of the library of the Department of musicology and cultural heritage prefer searches by a ‘Google like’ interface, that they search only known items, and that most used search data are author surname (21,9%), or author name and surname (21,9%), or author surname and a word from title (15,6%). "
