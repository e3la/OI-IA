What, however, IS a library catalog?\r\n","\r\n","According to part of the ODLIS entry for [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog):\r\n","\r\n","> **catalog**  \r\n","> A [comprehensive](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#comprehensive) list of the [books](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#book), [periodicals](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#periodical), [maps](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#map), and other [materials](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libmaterials) in a given [collection](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libcollec), arranged in systematic order to facilitate [retrieval](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#inforetrieval) (usually [alphabetically](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#alphabetical) by [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title), and/or [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject)).

It may be a card catalog (see photographs in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog)) or it may be an online catalog.

The descriptive information in the record gives users information about the library resource (title, author, publisher, etc.) and about the content of the resource (summary, subjects, tables of contents, etc.).
