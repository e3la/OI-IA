Key Ideas in IO: User Tasks, a Reprise
======================================

### **![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633235/download)**

### **Revisit the User Tasks Presented in Module 3**

[Key Ideas in IO: User Tasks](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-user-tasks?module_item_id=2506794)

Always, keep the LRM user tasks in mind! How do the choices regarding description and the metadata elements included impact our users' ability to:

*   FIND relevant resources by searching in a database;
*   IDENTIFY specific aspects of the resource (edition, author, title);
*   SELECT resources that meet their specific information needs;
*   OBTAIN the resource using call numbers, URLs, etc.;
*   EXPLORE additional options via information in the surrogate record and database.

Review the metadata you identified in the last exercise. Which metadata elements could be used to support each of the user tasks?

Readings are available in Further Study for those with the time and inclination to dive in a bit more.
