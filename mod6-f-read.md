Self Study: Mechanics of Using and Applying Controlled Vocabularies
===================================================================

![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633222/preview)  
You have already done a bit of experimenting with controlled vocabularies—both in ERIC and in library catalogs. Take this opportunity to use one of the thesauri made available through the Getty—the [Art and Architecture Thesaurus (Links to an external site.)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)—to search for descriptors pertaining to art in their database.

Pretend you work at a museum and need to a curator understand the best terms to use for some newly-arrived artworks. Use the thesaurus, learn as much about its mechanics as you can. Take at least five minutes—you may need longer, but five minutes is a start.

Then, answer the following questions:

> 1.  What is the Hierarchical Position of the descriptor "**Dutch ripple molding frames**"?
> 2.  What is the preferred term for **Banana oil**? What are its properties?
> 3.  What are the synonyms for **Vegetable parchment** that are not used in the thesaurus? HINT: These terms exist in the record, but do not appear in the hierarchy and are not "preferred."

N.B. This is not exactly the process you would undertake if you were an information intermediary working to organize these materials by applying subject headings.

And if you were the cataloger???

In that case, you would likely create a short statement that included both _aboutness_ and _isness_ information. 

> **Example:** _This painting is in the style of Van Eyck but painted in modern times in North America._ 

You would then identify the terminology that might be searched by your users, and would use the thesaurus to identify the correct controlled vocabulary term to convey those ideas.
