        "> [Still Image File (Links to an external site.)](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/products/definitions/raster-type.html): A type of digital object that is created from the digitization of still image (textual documents and photographs) originals. A still image is data in which a grid or raster of picture elements (pixels) has been mapped to represent a visual subject, e.g., the page of a book or a photograph. The term raster data is often contrasted with vector data, in which geometrical points, lines, curves, and shapes are based upon mathematical equations, thus creating an image without specific mapping of data to pixels. \\[From the [FADGI Glossary (Links to an external site.)](http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/glossary.php)\\]\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Bit-depth, spatial resolution, and color encoding, for example, are all important characteristics of still images. Raster images can be stored in a variety of data formats, such as TIFF (.tif).\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "For example, if you have a GPS-enabled device with which you take photographs, the photographs you create will probably include embedded information about the latitude and longitude where you took the photo. If there's a clock on the device, the day and time will also be captured as part of the image file. The image itself will include information about the camera used, as well as the settings. Online platforms designed for sharing will also have information about who took the photo, what the title (or subject) is, when the photo was uploaded to the system, how other users have tagged it, and the comments left by users of the platform.
