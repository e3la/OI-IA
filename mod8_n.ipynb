        "*   **Pay special attention to the history of the evolution of online catalogs in libraries.** This OER does not focus on how online catalogs came to look as they do today (though a bit of the evolution of related technology is covered in \"Module 4. Historical Approaches to IO\")\r\n",
        "*   Also, please note the definition of and implications for the term \"discovery layer\"—how does that differ from \"discovery system\", a term that is particularly relevant in this module covering \"systems\"? And what about \"discovery service,\" a term you saw on the previous page?\r\n",
