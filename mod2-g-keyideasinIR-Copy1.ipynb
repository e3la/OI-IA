    "# Key Ideas in IR: Information Retrieval and Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the ideas in IO and IR are very complex. The next few pages in this module present a number of key ideas and terms that are instrumental. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to read the definitions, click on the examples, and make sure you understand these complex topics before moving on. \n",

    "## Information Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a definition of [information retrieval ](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#inforetrieval)from the ODLIS: \n",
    "\n",
    "> The process, methods, and procedures used to selectively recall recorded [information](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) from a [file](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#file) of [data](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#data). In [libraries](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) and [archives](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#archives), [searches](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#search) are typically for a [known item](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_jk.aspx#knownitem) or for information on a specific [subject](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject), and the file is usually a human-readable [catalog](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog) or [index](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#index), or a computer-based [information storage and retrieval](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#isar) system, such as an [online catalog](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#onlinecatalog) or [bibliographic database](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdatabase). In designing such systems, balance must be attained between speed, [accuracy](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accuracy), cost, convenience, and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the information professions, the focus in IR tends to be on databases such as library catalogs or digital repositories. Information professionals, however, need to understand how IR works in general, including on the web. After all, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) is a database.\n",

    "> A **database** is an organized collection of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) \"Data (computing)\"), generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the databases used in the information professions are relational databases, with very specific ways for accessing and searching the content, and with specific kinds of information contained within. Wikipedia describes [Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) this way: \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **relational database** is a digital [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database \"Database\") based on the [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model \"Relational model\") of data, as proposed by [E. F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Codd \"E. F. Codd\") in 1970.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#cite_note-codd-1) A software system used to maintain relational databases is a [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system \"Relational database management system\") (RDBMS). Many relational database systems have an option of using the [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL \"SQL\") (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of \"query\" is important in this context. In fact, that is one aspect essential to databases—they can be queried. Follow this link to read about three primary ways a database can be queried: [https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/query.html](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/query.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Amazon:\n",
    "To use [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as an example, the database is the system that users query to find out if a certain book or product is available for purchase.\n",
