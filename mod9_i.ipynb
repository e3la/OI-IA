        "From the past few Modules, you have seen firsthand how complex metadata and metadata standards can be. These complexities are enhanced when information agencies want to share metadata or have their metadata harvested by a third party, including sources like [SHARE (Links to an external site.)](https://www.share-research.org/) and Google Scholar. Interoperability is improved when the use of standards is documented. A metadata application profile (MAP) documents the metadata guidelines for an institution or community.\n",

        "> A set of metadata elements, policies, and guidelines defined for a particular application or community.

In addition, sufficiently rich metadata provides greater context for a work. Therefore, these guidelines seek to ensure that records contributed to UC Shared Images provide a predictable level of documentation and are as consistent as possible across collections.\" (p. 6)\n",
