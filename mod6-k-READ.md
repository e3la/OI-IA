"Dewey Decimal Classification" (Wikipedia, 2020)
================================================

One of the stereotypical KOSs used in libraries is "Dewey." Librarians refer to this scheme as Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC).

Broadly, a few things stand out about DDC.

*   DDC is the most popular classification scheme in the world.
*   It is maintained by OCLC.
*   The notation uses only digits and a single mark of punctuation (the period).
*   The ENTIRE classification number in Dewey is a decimal.
    *   The WHOLE thing is a decimal, even the three digits preceding the decimal.
        *   This is very unintuitive!
    *   This is also essential to keep in mind when shelving materials and helping patrons.
    *   Therefore, we can talk about the tens, the hundreds, and the thousands in DDC:
        *   Example of tens: 500 Natural sciences and mathematics
        *   Example of hundreds: 540 Chemistry and allied sciences
        *   Example of thousands: 549 Mineralogy

#### Note

*   The whole article is interesting, but be sure to pay special attention to the end where criticisms are described.

_The final page of this module looks at another commonly used classification scheme in North America: The Library of Congress Classification (LCC)._
