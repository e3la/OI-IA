Subject Access in Retrieval Systems
===================================

**The Importance of Recording What a Resource is _About_**
==========================================================

In the retrieval systems maintained in libraries and in a number of information agencies and cultural heritage institutions, users want to be able to search topically.

Searching topically means that users want to be able to submit a query based on the topic or subject of interest and want to be able to pull a relevant set of documents based on that.

This is probably not dissimilar from the retail websites you investigated in the first Part of this class as your Short Paper.

**A Closer Look at KOSs in IO**
-------------------------------

To begin, this module focuses on **subject access in information agencies**—especially in libraries, but many of the ideas are applicable much more broadly. Remember back to the [Key Ideas in IO: The Elements of Library Cataloging](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-the-elements-of-library-cataloging?module_item_id=2506793) from module 3 (module 3 is where Figure 1 (reproduced below with an additional element) was introduced). 

**Figure 1 Two Main Aspects of "Cataloging" as Library Organization and Their Components, with Aspects Relating to Subject Cataloging Circled**

![Chart showing library and where subject cataloging fits in](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633238/preview)

Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) include both classification schemes and controlled vocabularies, as indicated in the image above. To revisit the discussion of KOSs from Part I, return to the page from Module 3 entitled [Key Ideas in IO: KOSs](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-koss "Key Ideas in IO: KOSs ")

KOSs support subject cataloging, and retrieval based on _aboutness._ How does that tie in to the image above? Simple: KOSs _ARE_ how information professionals record _aboutness_ information in surrogates.

What does _aboutness_ mean in the context of IO and retrieval? Essentially, it is synonymous with other terms that might be more familiar to you like _topicality_ or _subject_. As with much of this, terms of art allow for unambiguous discussion of ideas that otherwise might be clouded by the way people use language informally. 

From the ODLIS, here is the definition of [_aboutness_](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#aboutness):

> The totality of [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject)s explicitly or implicitly addressed in the [text](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#text) of a [document](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#document), including but not limited to the meaning(s) of the [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title), the stated and unstated intentions of the [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), and the ways in which the [information](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) may be used by [reader](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#reader)s. Levels of [specificity](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#specificity) must be considered in ascertaining the subject(s) of a [work](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#work). In the case of the hypothetical [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title) **_The Japanese Teamwork Approach to Improving High School Effectiveness_**, is the work about:
> 
> 1.  education?
> 2.  educational effectiveness?
> 3.  high school effectiveness?
> 4.  teamwork?
> 5.  a Japanese approach to teamwork?
> 
> As a general rule, [catalogers](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloger) and [index](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#index)ers assign the most specific [subject headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading) that describe the significant [content](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#content) of the [item](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem). In a [post-coordinate](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#postcoordinate) [indexing](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#indexing) system such as the one used in the _[ERIC](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#eric)_ [database](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdatabase), the [descriptor](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descriptor)s "Educational effectiveness," "High schools," "Japan," and "Teamwork" would probably be assigned to the example given above, but in a [pre-coordinate](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#precoordinate) system, such as the _[Library of Congress Subject Headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#lcshlist)_ list, the appropriate [headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_h.aspx#heading) might be "High schools--Japan," "Teacher effectiveness--Japan," and "Teaching teams--Japan." **_See also_**: [summarization](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#summarization).

In short, an item's _aboutness_ really is, quite simply, what it is about. Although some terms of art are not intuitive, this one is. The examples provided here use verbal subject access, but other means are available. Please note that subject headings and descriptors can take different approaches to conveying the aboutness of a resource. You will want to spend a good deal of time clicking through the hyperlinked terms in the definition until things start to make more sense. As always, you are encouraged to test all of this by opening ERIC and MU's MERLIN catalog to search for these terms. 

#### Conveying _Aboutness_ through KOSs

In the information professions, _aboutness_ (and _isness_—or aspects relating to what an item _is,_ including its [genre](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#genre)) can be conveyed in the following two ways:

*   **verbal subject access** (which is found broadly throughout retrieval systems and tools, which has correlates in Twitter and social media, and which is very intuitive). Here are a few examples of verbal subject access KOSs you may be familiar with:
    *   Library of Congress Subject Headings
    *   Search Subject Headings
    *   BISAC ([the terms on the back of mass-market paperbacks](https://bisg.org/page/BISACEdition))
*   **classification** (which is found more narrowly in library catalogs, in biology, in philosophy to an extent, but also in practical classifications). Here are a few examples of classification schemes you may be familiar with:
    *   Dewey Decimal Classification
    *   Library of Congress Classification
    *   Universal Decimal Classification
    *   Colon Classification
    *   This set of classes, from the UK Cabinet Office (2018) on level of sensitivity of information (see Figure 2)

#### **Next**

_Because it is intuitively applied to information and is readily used in a variety of digital and analog environments, this module begins with a closer look at **verbal subject access**._
