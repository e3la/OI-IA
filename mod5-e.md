# "Setting the Stage" (Gilliland, 2016)

An interesting reading about the value, types of, and characteristics of metadata.

> Gilliland, A. J. (2016). Setting the stage. In M. Baca (Ed.), _Introduction to metadata_.(3rd ed.). The Getty Research Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/setting-the-stage/](http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/setting-the-stage/)

From the Introduction to the book (emphasis added):

> At the end of her chapter, Anne Gilliland compares metadata to an investment that, if wisely managed, can deliver a significant return on intellectual capital. I would venture to expand on her financial metaphor and say that **metadata is one of our most important assets**. Hardware and software come and go—sometimes becoming obsolete with alarming rapidity—but high-quality, standards-based, system-independent metadata can be used, reused, migrated, and disseminated in any number of ways, even in ways that we cannot anticipate at this moment (as in the case of linked open data, which is a relatively recent concept).

#### Notes

*   This chapter covers the use of metadata in libraries, archives, and museums. 
*   See Table 1. A typology of data standards. The types of standards with examples will give you an idea of the complexity of metadata work.
*   A useful introduction to the value of metadata and what should be considered in the use of metadata.
*   Pay special attention to Table 3, which lists the attributes and characteristics of metadata, and to the list of the primary functions of metadata.

#### **Next**

_Next, a quick consideration of the purpose of metadata as presented in three standards documents._
