# What Is Metadata?

## What Is Metadata?

[Metadata](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#metadata), according to the ODLIS is: 

> Literally, "[data](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#data) about data." Structured information describing information resources/objects for a variety of purposes. Although [_AACR2_](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#anglo)/[MARC](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#machinecat) [cataloging](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloging) is formally metadata, the [term](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#term) is generally used in the library community for nontraditional schemes such as the [Dublin Core](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#dublincore) Metadata Element Set, the VRA Core Categories, and the [Encoded Archival Description (EAD)](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#ead). Metadata has been categorized as [descriptive](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descripmetadata), [structural](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#strucmetadata), and [administrative](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#adminmetadata). _Descriptive metadata_ facilitates [indexing](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#indexing), [discovery](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#discoveryservice), identification, and selection. _Structural metadata_ describes the internal structure of complex information resources. _Administrative metadata_ aids in the management of resources and may include [rights](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#rights) management metadata, [preservation metadata](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#presmetadata), and technical metadata describing the physical characteristics of a resource. For an introduction to metadata, please see Priscilla Caplan's _Metadata Fundamentals for All Librarians_ (American Library Association, 2003). Also spelled _meta-data_. **_See also_**: [Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mets) and [Metadata Object Description Schema](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mods).

## Structured Information

Focus on this part of the ODLIS definition: "**Structured information** **describing information resources/objects for a variety of purposes**." This is a great place to start. Metadata is structured information. In LAMs, metadata generally is provided to support identification, discovery, selection, use, access, and management. 

Note the difference between these two descriptions of a book:

> "I read a great book last week. It was a biography of Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson."

Author: Isaacson, Walter  
Title: Benjamin Franklin : an American life  
Publisher: Simon & Schuster Paperbacks  
Copyright date: c2003

Both include information about the attributes of a particular book. Only the second makes use of structure in the description. The first description might enable a person to find a bibliographic record for the book in a retrieval system, but the results of a search will be more precise when the structured information is used.

## Encoding Metadata

Module 4 included information on standards for encoding metadata. The encoding is another way of providing "labels" that are machine readable. This labeling enables the retrieval system to differentiate the pieces of information, so that a person can search by author and title, etc. Encoding is not present in the first description. The best one could hope for would be retrieval through a general keyword search. Think back to the discussion about precision. The structured, encoded metadata plays a large role in search results that are precise and relevant. 

The descriptive metadata covered this week assumes that there is an encoding scheme in use that enables a computer to recognize what each piece of data represents. 

**For now, think of metadata as being structured information that helps organize or support understanding of a resource, that is available through a retrieval system or tool.** The surrogates in library catalogs are great examples of metadata records. In a library catalog the contents of the book aren't searchable; it is the metadata in each record that is searched.
