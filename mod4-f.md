# The Origins of Museums, Organizers of Artifacts

When and how were museums started? How does IO play a part? A great NPR piece by Bob Mondello from 2008 about Stephen Asma's 2003 book (the cover is shown in Figure 1) can help fill in some of the gaps.

> 'The earliest museums really were, for lack of a better term, they were kind of freak shows,' historian Stephen Asma, author of _Stuffed Animals and Pickled Heads_, told NPR in 2002. 'The bizarre was collected together with sober specimens with no real order or organization.
> 
> Though Asma says curators didn't have the 'scientific agenda' that they do today, that agenda wasn't being neglected. Around the time Barnum was turning his museums into carnivals, a somewhat startled U.S. Congress was dealing with an unexpected bequest from an Englishman named James Smithson. His will asked for the establishment of a Smithsonian Institution for the 'increase and diffusion of knowledge.' (Education Or Entertainment?, para. 2–3)

Collections of artifacts, like collections of books, are not problematic for retrieval if the collection is small and there is an individual who knows it well. Once collections are larger, in libraries as in museums, organization is essential.

Cultural history and anthropology museums are incredibly popular, but should they be? Turner reminds us of the darker side of the origins of many:

> In one respect, the history of museums is one of colonial collections and engagements with otherness—encounters with cultures, peoples, and objects previously unknown. Historicizing how collections were amassed and how a study of material culture developed and became normalized is important to a holistic understanding of the development of modern ethnographic museums. (Turner, 2016, p. 102)

And are museums elitist? Think about what you know about museums, and consider this perspective:

> In 1917, John Cotton Dana, a well-known museum pioneer, published his seminal article, “The Gloom of the Museum,” in which he called on museum professionals to reevaluate their notions of an exclusive museum patronage and develop new methods to reach out to a greater audience. (Hajibayova & Latham, 2017, p. 506)

Some of you might be familiar with [John Cotton Dana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cotton_Dana).

His Wikipedia page further explains:

> **John Cotton Dana** (born August 19, 1856 in [Woodstock, Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Vermont "Woodstock, Vermont") – died July 21, 1929 in [Newark, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey "Newark, New Jersey")) was an American [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library "Library") and [museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum "Museum") director who sought to make these [cultural institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_property "Cultural property") relevant to the daily lives of citizens. As a [public librarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library "Public library") for forty years Dana promoted the benefits of reading, pioneered direct access to shelved materials, and innovated specialized library services of all types.

So it is not only a problem of the people being described in the museum, and their artifacts, but then also getting a broad base of patrons to the museums to explore the different ideas presented there. Later in the semester, when the topic returns to problems of bias in IO, factors relating to the injustice of classification schemes that do not apply a worldview consistent with the groups being studied, but rather impose a Western, positivist, "universal" worldview will be covered.
