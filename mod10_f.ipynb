        "    *   Hint: RDA stands for Resource Description and Access. It is a descriptive cataloging standard that informs what and how information is recorded in bibliographic records. \n",
        "    *   If you are having trouble remembering what RDA is, now is really the time to make sure you understand before moving on!\n",
        "*   You already saw that RDA was revolutionary in moving cataloging metadata forward, but did you realize \\*how\\* it was meant to move cataloging forward?\n",
        "    *   Do you understand how RDA is linked data friendly, and will enable new approaches to integration into the semantic web? Read the article by Ullah et al. ( (2018) carefully for information about the role of RDA in the era of the semantic web.\n",
        "    *   Note that RDA focuses on discrete metadata elements, while the previous standard, AACR2, focused on metadata strings. Discrete metadata elements can be structured for linked data technologies.\n",
        "*   Side note about the source: The journal _ITAL_ (_Information Technoogy and Libraries,_ usually pronounced /eye-tal/) is the journal started by the ALA division called LITA (Library and Information Technology Association)\n",
        "    *   In 2020, LITA, a division, was combined with ALCTS, another ALA division, and LLAMA (yet another division) to create a brand new ALA division called Core: [http://www.ala.org/core/](http://www.ala.org/core/)\n",
