In this case, the user already knows the name of the author and/or the title of the item, or has identified a topic of interest. In their searches, users hope to bring together everything in the collections based on the search (i.e., to collocate based on author, title, or topic), and then to evaluate what they find. You will find these ideas presented below.\r\n","\r\n","Below is part of the definition of [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx) from the ODLIS:\r\n","\r\n","> **catalog**  \r\n","> The purpose of a library catalog, as stated by Charles C.

This allowed librarians to work backwards and to devise rules about the content they would provide in surrogate records.\r\n","\r\n","**Choice of Content in Bibliographic Records**\r\n","----------------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","The list of objectives devised by Cutter might seem limited today. Why were librarians initially so hesitant to include too much information in a catalog card? Several very practical reasons guide this work:\r\n","\r\n","*   Catalog cards needed to include just enough to meet the needs presented\r\n","    *   Too much information took too much time for the cataloger to supply.\r\n","        *   The more information there was, the greater the chance for mistakes.\r\n","    *   Too much information would not fit on a single card catalog card.
