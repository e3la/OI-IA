# "Basics of Metadata" (Lyberger, 2012)

Watch the 9-minute embedded video to reiterate what you just read, and to prepare to move forward thinking about this topic.

#### Notes

*   An interesting point that is covered is that metadata exists in many forms and exists outside of the work of LAMS. For example, the presenter notes that the title page of a book includes metadata.
*   As you watch the video, answer these questions for yourself:

*   *   What is metadata?
    *   What are examples of descriptive metadata?
    *   What are examples of structural metadata?
    *   What are types of administrative metadata and what are examples of each?
    *   What does metadata look like?
        *   Give examples.
    *   When is metadata created?
    *   Who creates it?
    *   How is metadata stored?
    *   How is metadata different from plain data?

#### **Next**

_Next are two chapters from an introductory book about metadata. One reading focuses on metadata and the web and the second shifts the focus to metadata in LAMs._
