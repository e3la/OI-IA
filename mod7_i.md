"Preservation Metadata" (Council of State Archivists, 2020)
===========================================================

> Council of State Archivists. (2020). Preservation metadata. [https://www.statearchivists.org/electronic-records/serp-framework/preservation-metadata](https://www.statearchivists.org/electronic-records/serp-framework/preservation-metadata)

#### Notes

*   You will want to read through this entire page. It gives conditions that can be used to evaluate the inclusion of preservation metadata. 
*   An important concept for some digital objects is the "chain of custody." Documenting the actions taken on a digital file can reveal whether the current file is the original file or is an authentic representation of the original.  
*   This site (SERP Framework) is packed with really good information about how preservation works in information systems. 

#### **Next**

_Having access to a resource that has been properly preserved is great. But can it be used? Read next about rights metadata and how information about use can be recorded._
