        "*   This is a quick, 12 minute, non-technical introduction to linked data. Remember that linked data is a technology that permits computers to understand content, and that this idea is a natural fit with LAM institutions given the way technology has progressed.\n",
        "*   As you watch, imagine how some of these ideas might apply to author or title or subject metadata.\n",
        "*   Pay attention to the techniques that are mentioned:\n",
        "    *   Data is deconstructed and packaged so that the information can be understood by machines.\n",
        "    *   Defining relationships is important. E.g., Jan is the parent of Tim.\n",
        "    *   Concepts and entities are expressed as URLs.\n",
        "    *   Knowledge graphs are a way to model the data.\n",

When the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Norway began a project to make content of a print encyclopedia of Norwegian artists available online, the project involved more than digitizing and posting pages.
