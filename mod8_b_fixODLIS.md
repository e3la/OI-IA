Catalogs as Library Systems
===========================

**Systems for Storing and Organizing Information**
==================================================

**What Is a "System" in the Context of IO?**
--------------------------------------------

Electronic content—from the information itself to the metadata that information professionals and others laboriously create—needs to be managed in very specific ways. Information professionals working in information agencies and the cultural heritage sector have worked with vendors to develop specialized systems, such as online catalogs, to manage information about information resources in libraries.

In IO, "systems" usually refers to software such as databases that permit people to carry out complex, information-related tasks. For example, **retrieval systems** were introduced in [Module 2. Introduction to Retrieval and Retrieval Systems & Tools](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/modules/361584).

The Getty's metadata primer (Baca, 2016) includes a great glossary of relevant terms. It defines [system](http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/glossary/#system) in the following way: 

> _Also_ called a [computer system](http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/glossary/#computer_system). A number of interrelated hardware and software components that work together to store and convert data into information by using electronic processing. _See also_ [database](http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/glossary/#database).

Given what you have learned about online library catalogs, they meet these requirements for a "system" as the term is defined in the information professions. The library catalog, however, has not always been online (a topic that was a main focus in [Module 4](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/modules/361586 "Module 4. Historical Approaches to IO [dates]")). How has the library catalog evolved into the (computerized) system it is today? 

**The Library Catalog, Yesterday and Today**
--------------------------------------------

Catalogs of library materials were the cornerstone for discovering the resources in libraries for a long time. Early versions included books (in the US and Canada, the [National Union Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_Catalog) was a kind of catalog) and [card catalogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog). Later, with computer automation, online catalogs took center stage. As more library resources have become available online, there has been a shift toward systems that search a multitude of resources at one time, including the resources listed in catalogs. Catalogs are no longer the only ways to find information in modern libraries, but they continue to play an important role in library discovery. 

In Module 3, you were introduced to definitions and examples of library **catalogs**, along with a bit of self-study.

[Key Ideas in IO: The Elements of Library Cataloging](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-the-elements-of-library-cataloging "Key Ideas in IO: The Elements of Library Cataloging")

[Self-Study: Library Catalog Deeper Dive](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/self-study-library-catalog-deeper-dive "Self-Study: Library Catalog Deeper Dive")

Revisit these pages for a gentle reminder if you are unsure of some of specifics. In addition, consider the [SAA Glossary](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/catalog.html), which gives this simple definition for catalog:

> 1\. a collection of systematically arranged descriptions of materials.
> 
> A note indicates that, "catalogs may be in a variety of formats, including bound volumes, cards, microform, or online databases."

Many catalogs today are digital and are called online catalogs. The ODLIS defines [online catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#onlinecatalog) in the following way: 

> A [library](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog) consisting of a collection of [bibliographic record](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord)s in [machine-readable](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#machinereadable) [format](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#format), maintained on a [dedicated](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#dedicated) computer that provides uninterrupted [interactive](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#interactive) [access](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#access) via [terminal](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#terminal)s or [workstation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#workstation)s in direct, continuous communication with the central computer. Although the [software](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#software) used in online catalogs is [proprietary](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#proprietary) and not [standardized](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#standardization), most [online](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#online) catalogs are [searchable](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#searchable) by [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title), [subject heading](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading), and [keywords](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_jk.aspx#keywords), and most [public](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#publiclibrary) and [academic libraries](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#academiclib) in the United States provide free public access, usually through a [Web](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#www)\-based [graphical user interface](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#graphicaluser). \[...\] Synonymous with [OPAC](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#opac).

As noted at the end of this definition, the online catalog may be called an [OPAC. ](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#opac)"OPAC" is pronounced /oh-pack/ (it is technically an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) pronounced as a word, not an [initialism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/initialism)) and stands for online public access catalog, referring to the public-facing functions of the catalog. The ODLIS defines [OPAC ](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#opac)in the following way:

> An [acronym](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#acronym) for _**o**nline **p**ublic **a**ccess **c**atalog_, a [database](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#database) composed of [bibliographic record](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord)s [describing](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdescrip) the [book](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#book)s and other [materials](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libmaterials) owned by a [library](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) or [library system](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#librarysystem), [accessible](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accessibility) via public [terminal](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#terminal)s or [workstation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#workstation)s usually concentrated near the [reference desk](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#refdesk) to make it easy for users to request the assistance of a trained [reference librarian](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#reflibrarian). Most [online catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#onlinecatalog)s are [searchable](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#searchable) by [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title), [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject), and [keywords](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_jk.aspx#keywords) and allow users to [print](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#printing), [download](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#download), or [export](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#export) records to an [e-mail](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#email) account. Compare with [WebPac](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#webpac). **_See also_**: [Machine-Readable Cataloging](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#machinecat).

This definition refers to the term WebPac. That term is not commonly used today. Early online catalogs had text or command-line interfaces (remember those from [Module 2](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/modules/361584 "Module 2. Introduction to Retrieval and Retrieval Systems & Tools [dates]")?). The development of a graphical interface led to the use of the term WebPac to differentiate the two methods of interacting with the catalog.  Refer to the video in Module 2, "Keyboards & command line interfaces" for a refresher on text based—or command line—interfaces. 

Today, the online library catalog is probably not being used alone. Understanding the basics of the online library catalog, however, is essential for understanding further advances. It also is necessary for those working in smaller operations and who must rely on a simple online catalog alone. 

**In This Module**
------------------

In addition to describing online catalogs, this Module will introduce issues relating to technology that supports the use and sharing of bibliographic records as surrogates. This short unit will not give you a comprehensive overview of all the issues that arise with the adoption of  systems used in libraries and by library users. Its goal is to raise your awareness of some issues and to prompt you to ask questions when you use a snazzy system.

All library systems and tools will have problems—slowness or lack of customization are two common examples. The issues covered here relate less to software weaknesses and more to bigger picture issues.

#### **Next**

_A chapter from_ The Discipline of Organizing_. It gives an overview of elements to consider when designing a system. This will be followed by information more specific to online_ _catalogs._
