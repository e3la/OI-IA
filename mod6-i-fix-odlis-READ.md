Key Ideas in IO: Classification—Organizing Physical Items and Thinking About Categories
=======================================================================================

Up until now, this module has looked at verbal subject access—usually applied to promote retrieval in retrieval systems like databases and catalogs. This does not explain, however, how books are organized on the library's shelves.

**Grouping Together Items Physically**
======================================

It is one thing for surrogates to be retrievable in an online retrieval system. It is quite another to figure out a system for making the actual items retrievable in a physical space like a library.

Organizing materials in a library can be done based on various features of the information resources. Some possibilities include the following:

*   Sometimes items are given an accession number when they are added to a collection. Using that number to organize the items on the shelf is quick and easy. An advantage for users is that they can easily see the new items.
    *   A45678
    *   A45679
    *   A45680
*   Organizing by size would maximize space usage. One would still need a system to organize items of the same size.
*   Occasionally, users try to track down a book they have read, and the aspect of the book that they remember is its book color. Books on a shelf by color can be quite attractive.

**Organizing Books by Color**

Koncius, J. (August 4, 2015). Organizing books by color: which camp are you in? The Washington Post. Retrieved on March 12, 2020 from: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/organizing-books-by-color-which-camp-are-you-in/2015/08/03/e3688b04-37a1-11e5-9d0f-7865a67390ee\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/organizing-books-by-color-which-camp-are-you-in/2015/08/03/e3688b04-37a1-11e5-9d0f-7865a67390ee_story.html).

**Classification**
------------------

The downside for the systems mentioned is that they focus on an aspect of the item that does not have long-term value for users. It is much more advantageous to users to group things based on their topics. This is _classifying._

The Society of American Archivists defines [classification](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/classification) in the following way:

> n. (classify, v.) ~ 1. The organization of materials into categories according to a scheme that identifies, distinguishes, and relates the categories. - 2. The process of assigning materials a code or heading indicating a category to which it belongs; see code. - 3. The process of assigning restrictions to materials, limiting access to specific individuals, especially for purposes of national security; security classification.
> 
> **Notes:**
> 
> Classification may involve physically arranging the materials or use of a class code to index and retrieve documents stored in a different order. For electronic documents, classification may involve assigning a class code used to index and retrieve the document. In some schemes, documents may be assigned to more than one class. - Classification2 in libraries refers to the process of assigning a Dewey, Library of Congress, or other code to indicate where a book is to be shelved.

Classification numbers are the basis of call numbers. Classification notation is the _class_ number applied to the item.

All items belonging to a particular class will have the same class number. This promotes [serendipity.](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#serendipity) (Follow the link if you do not understand how the term _serendipity_ applies to the organization of physical material in libraries—it's important!)

Why promote serendipitous discovery of information? Because if a user wants a book on dogs, if all books on dogs are grouped together, the user might well find another book on dogs while browsing through the group of resources.  Planned serendipity!

All books on dogs, then, will have the same classification [notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_n.aspx#notation). Per the ODLIS:

> The set of [character](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#character)s ([numerals](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_n.aspx#numeral), [letters](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#letter) of the [alphabet](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#alphabet), and/or [symbols](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#symbol)) used to represent the [main classes](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mainclass) and [subdivisions](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subdivision) of a [classification system](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#classificationsys). In [library](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) [cataloging](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloging), the class notation assigned to a [bibliographic item](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem) represents its [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject) and is the first element of the [call number](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#callnumber), determining its position on the [shelf](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bookshelves) relative to items on other subjects. For example, the [class](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#class) notation assigned to the [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title) _Censorship: Opposing Viewpoints_ ([edited](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#editor) by Tamara Roleff) is **363.31** in [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#dewey) (DDC) and **Z658.U5** in [Library of Congress Classification](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#lcclassification) (LCC). **_See also_**: [base of notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#baseofnotation), [expressive notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#expressivenotation), [faceted notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#facetednotation), [mixed notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mixednotation), [mnemonic notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mnemonicnotation), and [pure notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#purenotation).

What is the rest of the call number, then? Easy. The rest of the call number usually includes an author number, which allows for books to be organized on the shelves alphabetically. 

Author numbers are called [author marks](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#authormark) in the ODLIS. 

> [Letters](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#letter), [numerals](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_n.aspx#numeral), or other [symbols](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#symbol) representing the last name of an [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), added by the [cataloger](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloger) to the [call number](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#callnumber) to distinguish an [item](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem) from others of the same [classification](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#classificationsys) (_example_: the [Cutter number](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cutternumber) **D548** to identify [work](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#work)s by Charles Dickens). When a [work mark](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#workmark) is added to the author mark, the result is known as the [book number](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#booknumber) (**D548d** for _David Copperfield_). Synonymous with _author number_.
