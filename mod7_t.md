Module 7. For Further Study
===========================

 **![](recommend-icon.png) For Further Study**
=================================================================================================

> Riley, J. (2017). _Understanding metadata: What is metadata, and what is it for?_ National Information Standards Organization (NISO). [https://groups.niso.org/apps/group\_public/download.php/17446/Understanding%20Metadata.pdf](https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/17446/Understanding%20Metadata.pdf)

##### Notes

*   Consider reading all of the Riley (2017) metadata primer published by NISO. It might seem a little long, but there is a lot of good information in here.
*   This "primer" document provides a deeper dive into the question of what metadata is and some of the relevant specifics.
*   Remember: NISO is one of the primary standards bodies in the United States.
*   **About the author:** Jenn Riley is a well-known and influential metadata librarian. One of her most influential early works was to define and create a visualization of four aspects of metadata that is used by the information professions: [http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/](http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/)[](http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/)

##### Notes

*   A standard for preservation metadata.
*   From the PREMIS website ([https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/)): "The PREMIS Data Dictionary and its supporting documentation is a comprehensive, practical resource for implementing preservation metadata in digital archiving systems. The Data Dictionary is built on a data model that defines five entities: Intellectual Entities, Objects, Events, Rights, and Agents. Each semantic unit defined in the Data Dictionary is a property of one of the entities in the data model."
*   A very detailed metadata scheme for preservation metadata.
*   Note that for it to be implemented in a digital archiving system, that system must include the option to include the fields defined by this standard.
*   It is assumed that some of the metadata will be generated by the system. E.g., when a digital file is edited, that information is captured and stored as preservation metadata.
*   This is another standard maintained by the Library of Congress.

A number of factors need to be taken into consideration when working with non-textual materials.

> Cornell University Library. (2003). Moving theory into practice: Digital imaging tutorial. [http://preservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/contents.html](http://preservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/contents.html) 

##### Notes

*   This tutorial is quite old and is no longer maintained.
*   However, it gives a really good idea of some of the big picture things that information professionals do when working with digital image files, even if the specifics are not up to date. 
*   If you are interested in work with image files (either cataloging them, working in archives, helping patrons and customers, etc.), this tutorial is a good way to get your feet wet.
*   Of relevance to this module is a table on types of metadata, that will provide a review of content covered:
    *   Table 5.1. Types of metadata. Link from the following page: [http://preservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/metadata/metadata-01.html](http://preservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/metadata/metadata-01.html)

#### Embedding Different Scripts

Not all languages are spelled using the Latin alphabet. The Library of Congress talks about the JACKPHY (Japanese, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Persian, Hebrew and Yiddish) languages.

> Learn some of the history of their use in the LC catalog here: [https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0712/cataloging.html](https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0712/cataloging.html) 

From a metadata standpoint, though, how are letters encoded in word processing documents, MARC records, and on the web? This Wikipedia page will get you started. 

> UTF-8. (2020, September 23). In _Wikipedia._ [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&oldid=979905287](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&oldid=979905287) 

##### Notes

*   UTF-8 is encoding that documents and databases use.
*   Understanding specifics is important, especially if you end up working with non-Latin scripts (the so-called JACKPHY languages).

#### Bringing It All Together

Finally, consider reading this short essay by Foote (2019) relating to metadata, which provides a slightly different perspective on what this OER has been covering. 

> Foote, K. D. (2019, February 28). A brief history of metadata. [https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-metadata/](https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-metadata/)
