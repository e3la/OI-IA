# The Work of Information Intermediaries

## Information Intermediaries in Their Professional Environments

In archives, archivists might specialize in arrangement and description ... or might do it all. In libraries, information organization (IO) generally is practiced as cataloging librarianship or metadata librarianship. Those working with the organization of digital resources might include electronic resources or digital services librarians and scholarly communication librarians. In museums, curators will need to organize the artifacts, both for themselves (to be able to find and identify the artifacts) and also for presentation in collections to the museum patrons. In offices, employees will need to think about personal information management (PIM). Specialists may be employed, too, and they may focus on knowledge management (KM) of employee knowledge; access to the organization's assets; and the discovery and presentation of new knowledge about external factors (such as the work carried out through current awareness services and competitive intelligence/research work). Finally, on the internet and through other information and communication technologies (ICTs) professionals work to organize content for consumption and use by machines and users. This content can include social media and may work with big data, artificial intelligence, data science, etc.

Given this course is a library and information science approach to organization of information, this course will focus on libraries, archives, and to a lesser extent, museums, but will mention examples from offices and the internet since these environments overlap with the professional work being done in information agencies.

**"Organized" versus "Disorganized" = Not a Problem!**

Fortunately for our users, information intermediaries do not need to be people with meticulously organized sock drawers or spotless desks to be successful professionals. Plenty of information professionals who do organization of information for a living have extremely messy office desks. 

Reflect for a moment: Are you the kind of person who is disorganized and needs help?

Information professionals come with a variety of backgrounds and can be successful regardless of whether they are “organized” or “disorganized” in their personal lives. 

But, when it comes to their professional duties to make information available and retrievable by our user, well… that is a different story altogether. Fortunately, all humans are inherent organizers in some way or another, and all can learn to organize professionally!

**Inherent Organization**
-------------------------

Putting aside personal preferences and personality features, the human mind systematically seeks to organize, and to make sense of its surroundings. Cognitively, individuals make sense of the world around them based on what they have already seen. In contextualizing knowledge organization systems (KOSs), Hodge (2000) writes the following:

> It is often said that humans are inherent organizers. From an early age, children play sorting and matching games. We cope with our ever-changing world by comparing new objects or experiences with those with which we are familiar, identifying patterns and categorizing what is new into our existing frame of reference.

Don't believe her? Think of the last time you saw a fancy faucet that was a little mysterious.

Since you already know how to use one like this:

...I'm confident you can work through using this one too.

As Hodge (2000) explained, when you look at something new, your mind makes connections to what it has already seen.

This is useful trait for organizing in a way that is intuitive and usable by others. While useful, that is not enough for success. The field of IO provides information about the principles and tools used by information professionals. 

**Why IO?**
-----------

This class covers principles and practices for organizing materials in **information environments.** 

When many students come to study LIS, they have never thought much about _organizing information._ Sometimes, that is because most organizing goes on behind the scenes. In some cases, students might not even be aware it is a thing!

Rest assured: NOTHING else works if organization has not taken place. That is true in information agencies, on the web, in social media, your desktop, with your photos on your phone, etc. 

The content of this course may be a little un-intuitive—challenging, even! IO is the foundation of everything the information professions do, however, so it is a great place to start. 

In this class, we will be looking at the many environments in which information is organized, how that information gets organized, standards that are used, etc. There is much more to it than you probably dreamed possible!

Although our systems are imperfect, a result of the biases we all have, they are critical to the work of libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs). 

*   It comes down to the fact that nothing would be usable if not for organization. In the information professions, organization does not just happen.
*   When organizing information in today’s technology rich-environments, some information still needs to be supplied by human intermediaries.
*   Nearly every element of the authority record for the LCSH term was created manually by someone, somewhere.
*   In information environments information has to be organized in order to be retrieved, and computers just are not as smart as humans!

#### **Next**

_The next page in this module looks at the problem of bias. All humans have biases, but information intermediaries need to understand how this can affect users, and how to make sure that biases in the systems, in the vocabularies, and in the mindsets of the information creators and organizers does not harm users, or keep them from acquiring and using resources in any way._
