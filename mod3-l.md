Key Ideas in IO: User Tasks
===========================

**What Do Users Need to Do?**
-----------------------------

The reason that information professionals create and maintain the retrieval systems mentioned in Module 2 is to provide access to the collections for users. When users use these systems, especially catalogs, what are the tasks they should expect to be able to accomplish? Cutter described several tasks. A more recent study of user needs resulted in the development of the five user tasks.

The IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) (2017, p. 15), identifies and describes the five user tasks that define the needs of information seekers:

|Table 3.1   	|   	User Tasks Summary|
|---	|---	|
|   	Find|   To bring together information about one or more resources of interest by searching on any relevant criteria	|
|   	Identify|  To clearly understand the nature of the resources found and to distinguish between similar resources 	|
|   	Select|  To determine the suitability of the resources found, and to be enabled to either accept or reject specific resources 	|
|   	Obtain|  To access the content of the resource 	|
|   	Explore|  To discover resources using the relationships between them and thus place the resources in a context 	|



#### Notes

*   These user tasks were a focal point in the development of current, international cataloging guidelines, Resource Description and Access (RDA), which were implemented by the Library of Congress and other libraries in the United States beginning in 2013. RDA has been adopted by libraries in other countries, also.
*   These tasks can be used at a local level to help catalogers and other information professionals prioritize the elements of a surrogate record that are the most important for users. This is an important consideration when resources for cataloging are limited.

#### **Next**

_Information intermediaries operate under a number of assumptions when they create access to resources by developing records. The whole process of adhering to norms and standards as a way of meeting user expectations is part of the work involved in_ bibliographic control.
