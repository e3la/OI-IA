#### An Introduction to Retrieval and Retrieval Systems & Tools

Organization of information happens to support the retrieval of information. Depending on the classes youÂ  have already taken, you may have studied concepts relative to storage, retrieval, and access, and the services that information professionals provide related to these.

When it comes to retrieval, it is important to understand where libraries and other information agencies have been and how they arrived at where they are today. Most importantly, knowing the history of retrieval supports the understanding of the development of organizational systems, trends in future system development, and strategies needed to move forward.
