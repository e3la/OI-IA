        "There are a few different ways to think about granularity, and some decisions that need to be made when managing a digital library. What is granularity? According to the ODLIS, [granularity](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#granularity) is:\n",
        "\n",
        "> The level of [descriptive](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdescrip) detail in a [record](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord) created to represent a [document](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#document) or [information](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) resource for the purpose of [retrieval](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#inforetrieval), for example, whether the [record structure](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#recordstructure) in a [bibliographic database](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdatabase) allows the [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author)'s name to be parsed into [given name](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#givenname) and [surname](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#surname).\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "First, consider how much time it takes to create descriptive metadata manually. The time of the information professional is incredibly valuable, so it should be put to the absolute best use. \n",
