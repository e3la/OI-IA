    "#### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "*   From an international, open access journal, which provides a view and an understanding that these issues are not unique to libraries in the United States or North America. (Do not let grammatical errors in the article deter your reading.)\n",
    "*   This is a quick read that will serve as a review of topics covered so far. Useful in that it covers, \"the information retrieval problem.\"\n",
    "*   Of note:\n",
    "    *   \"The explosive growth of information has made it a matter of survival for companies to have at their disposal good information retrieval tools. \" (p. 31)\n",
    "*   Describes these \"major tools\": Catalogues, Classification Schemes, Indexes, Abstracts, Bibliographies. (Note: The description of Abstracts ended up as the abstract for the article, rather than with the description of the other tools on pages 32-34.) As you read, consider the place of each of these tools in the retrieval of information resources today.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Next**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Considering the importance of technology to the organization of information and information retrieval, the next page considers the beginning of the digital era in organization and retrieval -- a time when online systems were decidedly user-unfriendly. Librarians and programmers were the only ones with the knowledge to search in a number of systems. You will want to keep in mind why and how these systems were designed as a way to understand just how far retrieval (and organization) has come._"
