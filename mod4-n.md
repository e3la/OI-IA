### **Non-Western (Chinese) Historical Approaches to IO**

[https://scholars.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/123456789/24621/2/Proclaiming%20Intellectual%20Authority%20through%20classification.pdf](https://scholars.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/123456789/24621/2/Proclaiming%20Intellectual%20Authority%20through%20classification.pdf) 

##### Notes

*   If your interest is in international and comparative librarianship, learning about different approaches to organizing around the world, throughout time, will appeal. 
*   These articles report on work that Dr. Lee carried out in China.

### **Non-English (French) Approaches to IO**

> Mingam, M. (2005). Rameau: bilan, perspectives. _Bulletin des bibliothèques de France,_ _50_(5), 38-47. [https://bbf.enssib.fr/consulter/bbf-2005-05-0038-001](https://bbf.enssib.fr/consulter/bbf-2005-05-0038-001)

##### Notes

*   If you can read French, these articles provide a stunning look at how LCSH has been adapted and adopted in French and francophone libraries. 
*   It also gives insight into how subject headings were constructed around the world prior to the advent of shared cataloging systems in the 1980s - this is very different from the US-based reliance on the Library of Congress.

### **Archives**

> Hensen, S, Landis, W., Roe, K., Rush, M., Stockting, W., and Walch, V. (2011). Thirty years on: SAA and descriptive atandards (Session 706), _The American Archivist, 74(_Supplement 1), 1–36. [https://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.suppl-1.15011hj3lg56t0t3](https://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.suppl-1.15011hj3lg56t0t3)

##### Notes

*   If your interest is in Archives, this provides good overview related to the development of archival standards in the United States.
*   This is a write-up of a series of presentations at the Society of American Archivists (SAA) conference.

### **Museums**

Following is Steven Lubar's article on museum catalogs. Check this out if you are interested in museums.

> Lubar, S. (2017). A brief history of American museum catalogs to 1860, Cataloging history, Part 1. [https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:788268/](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:788268/)

##### Notes

*   The author, Steven Lubar, is a professor of American Studies at Brown University.
*   In this article, he discusses published descriptions of museum collections and exhibitions.

> Dreyfus, J. (2016, June 13). _The evolution of the book_ \[Video\]. TED Ed.

##### Notes

*   Books are _artifacts_, much as any other kind of museum object, and can be studied as such for their physical characteristics, including how they are bound and presented. 
*   This short (less than 5 minutes) video from TED Ed presents the book as object, rather than focusing on its intellectual contents, as librarians tend to do.

### **Cataloging**

**Library Hand**

Here's a blog post about _library hand_ on the OCLC Research blog by \[then\] Chief Research Scientist Thom Hickey.

> Hickey, T. (2009, July 28). Library hand. _Outgoing. [https://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2009/07/library-hand.html](https://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2009/07/library-hand.html)_

##### Notes

*   If you had been in this program in 1935, you would have had to master library hand.
*   Standards have been with us a long, long time.

**Descriptive Codes in Cataloging**

Describing books in a way that is consistent is surprisingly difficult! To describe a book or two in a personal collection is one thing, but to have multiple catalogers describing hundreds or thousands of materials inevitably leads to inconsistent practices if there is no guidance.

> Strout, R. F. (1956). The development of the catalog and cataloging codes. _The Library Quarterly_, _26_(4), 254–275. [http://www.jstor.com/stable/4304573](http://www.jstor.com/stable/4304573)

##### Notes

*   This article, from 1956, traces the "early history" of cataloging codes—starting from 2000 BCE and moving on through the nineteenth century.
*   These codes generally describe physical characteristics of books—much of the content that ended up on the card catalog card was a direct result of the application of these standards.
*   Available through JSTOR, this article is not freely available on the internet.

> Hopkins, J. (1992). The 1791 French cataloging code and the origins of the card catalog. _Libraries & Culture, 27_(4), 378-404.

##### Notes

*   This really readable article describes the history of card catalog cards, and even includes some images that show what the first ones looked like.
*   Like the one above, this article is not freely available on the internet.
