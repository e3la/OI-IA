While this class does not cover the practice of cataloging and metadata creation, familiarity with standards used in the process is knowledge that can be applied when organizing information resources in numerous contexts.\r\n","\r\n","## The Value of Standards (Review)\r\n","\r\n","The adoption and application of standards and/or guidelines in metadata work helps to ensure that the metadata can be shared and that it meets minimum requirements by providing guidance for those creating the metadata.\r\n","\r\n","\"Cataloging Cultural Objects\" (a standard used for descriptive cataloging in museums), describes the importance of standards for those creating the metadata **and** for the end users (emphasis added):\r\n","\r\n","> Data standards not only promote the **recording of information consistently** but are also **fundamental to retrieving it efficiently**. They **promote data sharing, improve content management, and reduce redundant efforts**. In time, the accumulation of consistently documented records across multiple repositories will increase access to content by maximizing research results. Ultimately, uniform documentation will promote the development of a body of cultural heritage information that will greatly enhance research and teaching in the arts and humanities. (Baca et al., 2006, p. xi)\r\n","\r\n","## Content Standards\r\n","\r\n","Content standards are used in descriptive cataloging. They identify metadata elements and the type of information to be included in each element. Instructions for transcribing information and for creating standardized forms of metadata for access points (such as names) are part of content standards, too.\r\n","\r\n","Below are links to two content standards. One was written for museums and the other for archives. Review each to get an idea of what a content standard includes. Explore them with these questions in mind:\r\n","\r\n","*   What are the stated purposes for the standard?\r\n","*   What principles are applied in the application of the standard?\r\n","*   Does the standard list metadata elements that are required and must be supplied? \r\n","*   Review the instructions for a few specific metadata elements. What types of instructions are provided? \r\n","*   How much training would be needed to apply this standard? Could it used by someone without training? \r\n","*   Does the standard assume a specific encoding standard or retrieval system?\r\n","\r\n","> Baca, M., Harping, P., Lanzi, E., McRae, L., & Whiteside, A.
