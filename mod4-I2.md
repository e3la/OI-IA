# The Evolution of Containers and Encoding Standards

Just like the evolution of the alphabet (and its order) (Bodmer, 1972) and the evolution of standards relating to time zones (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) for the fascinating history of how the United States were divided into time zone based on the railroads), the evolution of containers, both physical and digital, took place over time.

## Physical Containers

Physical examples are a great, everyday example of standards in action. If you have ever seen a container port (or used [PODS](https://www.pods.com/) for moving or storage), you know that modular containers can be moved easily, and can feasibly hold any number of contents.

Everything from the sizes and shapes of soda cans to the shape of jugs of milk and even the standard size of bananas are all based on physical aspects.

#### Standards for "Containers" Used in the Information Professions

In many ways, the physical containers described above are like the records used in library retrieval tools—they are highly standardized, often interchangeable, easily transported, easily housed based on their expected dimensions and contents. Take a look at a typical container port (Figure 1) to see how interoperability plays out in shipping.

#### Card Catalog Cards

Historically, card catalog cards were used to contain information about library collections. Cards were first used in France after the Revolution, when the overthrown aristocracy's library collections were inventoried on the backs of playing cards before they were sold (Hopkins, 1992).

Did you know that even the size of the card catalog card is a standard? It developed over time, and eventually the current standard was adopted broadly. See the article at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog#Catalog_card) for more of this very important history.

In addition, the way the words were written on the card catalog card was also a matter of standardization. Consider, for example Melvil Dewey's instructions for _library hand_ from a textbook for librarians from 1887 (see in particular pages 272–283). Figure 2 shows the application of those rules that Dewey presents, in the form of an alphabet.

After handwritten Card Catalog Cards came typed cards, example below.

## Electronic Containers for Information and Data

In the electronic environment, the modular, standardized "digital containers" are what are used to encode the digital content.

HTML is the "container" used for web-based resources—it is a standard used with web browsers.

In libraries, the electronic "container" for information about books is encoded using the standard called MARC. MARC stands for MAchine-Readable Cataloging, and it was invented at the Library of Congress by the pioneer introduced in an earlier page, Henriette Avram.

Below in Figure 4 is a screenshot of the MARC view for a book called _The Matthew Effect: How Advantage Begets Further Advantage_ by Daniel Rigney. It was taken from the MERLIN catalog at the University of Missouri ([http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b7430224~S8.) ](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/record=b7430224~S8)

Take a look at the MARC version of the record below, then look at the patron-view in MERLIN to see how this content can be displayed on the web.

#### Tweets and Standards

Tweets sent on Twitter are a completely new kind of container for information. The tweets themselves may be notoriously short, but there's a surprising amount of encoding "underneath" all the tweets, including information about GPS-based location, the date, the account name, etc.

[Map of a Twitter Status Object](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/TweetMetadata.pdf)<br>
There is a non-graphical [object-model of a tweet is available from twitter developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet).

The "anatomy" was created in 2010, but it gives a great perspective on the kinds of information that social media is recording about users. (Did you know about the Please Rob Me bot, made as a joke—but actually identifying social media users tweeting about being on vacation?. Find out more at: [https://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/02/18/1340202/i-use-twitter-please-rob-me](https://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/02/18/1340202/i-use-twitter-please-rob-me). Such a bot relies on data about the tweet embedded in the "container" PLUS the content of the tweet to ascertain that a user is on vacation).

Tweets like the one above are encoded automatically. No information professionals at Twitter are behind the scenes looking up information about where each user is located. Twitter metadata generated and encoded is created automatically; library metadata is in general much less automated. In the next Part of this class, you will learn about the standards and practices involved in creating content in information agencies.
