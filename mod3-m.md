# Key Ideas in IO: Bibliographic Control

Ensuring that users can accomplish their tasks means a very standardized approach to organizing information for the information professionals overseeing work like cataloging. Cataloging is all about providing access. But what does that mean? 

[Access](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/Access%20in%20Information%20Agencies?titleize=0 "Access in Information Agencies") can mean a lot of things in information agencies. In the context of this Module, consider how the work information professionals do in organizing information facilitates _access_ to library resources. This is done through **bibliographic control**.

The following is the definition of [bibliographic control](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibcontrol) provided by the ODLIS:

> A broad [term](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#term) encompassing all the activities involved in creating, organizing, managing, and maintaining the [file](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#file) of [bibliographic record](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord)s representing the [item](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem)s held in a [library](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) or [archival](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#archives) [collection](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libcollec), or the sources listed in an [index](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#index) or [database](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#database), to facilitate [access](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#access) to the [information](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) contained in them. Bibliographic control includes the [standardization](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#standardization) of [bibliographic description](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdescrip) and [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject) access by means of uniform [catalog code](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalogcode), [classification system](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#classificationsys)s, [name authorities](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_n.aspx#nameauthority), and preferred [heading](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_h.aspx#heading)s; the creation and maintenance of [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog)s, [union list](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_u.aspx#unionlist)s, and [finding aid](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#findingaid)s; and the provision of physical access to the items in the collection. **_See also_**: [authority control](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#authoritycontrol).

All of the activities that are described in this class, when applied to library environments, are examples of bibliographic control. The page in this Module that included information about descriptive cataloging and subject cataloging, the page that described authority records and files... all of these activities are included in this notion of bibliographic control.

The Library of Congress has a unit with the name, "Acquisitions and Bibliographic Access Directorate." Its mission:

> **To provide innovative and effective bibliographic access to library materials** and leadership to the library and information communities. The Acquisitions and Bibliographic Access Divisions are responsible for the descriptive cataloging (physical attributes of the creative work, assignment of intellectual responsibility for the creation of the content, and the forms of names by which those responsible are to be represented in the catalog) of books, microforms, and computer files; and the subject analysis, Library of Congress classification, shelflisting (to provide unique call numbers), and Dewey Decimal classification of books, special formats, and some serials. The divisions provide leadership in cataloging policy for the national and international library communities and the secretariat for the Program for Cooperative Cataloging, an international consortium which promotes the creation of shared cataloging which meets international standards.

This is what the organization of information is about!

Information professionals facilitate access to library resources through retrieval systems and tools. Users do not have to browse the shelves of books and other resources in a library. They can use the library catalog (or another system supporting retrieval) to discover resources that meet their needs. 

#### **Next**

_This Module has focused so far on library catalogs because, as it was explained, library catalogs exemplify a number of elements that are essential to understand. Other kinds of organizations and institutions also employ information intermediaries to organize material, however, and their processes and procedures are equally compelling._
