"Library of Congress Classification" (Wikipedia, 2020)
======================================================

Whereas DDC is used in public, school, and small libraries principally, LCC is used in academic and research libraries like MU.

*   LCC notation includes both numbers and letters—and periods.
*   Class numbers are WHOLE NUMBERS (this is important for shelving).
    *   Anything after the decimal is a decimal; anything before it is a whole number.

Finish this Module by reading the article on LCC in Wikipedia. 

> Library of Congress Classification. (2020, December 26). In _Wikipedia_. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Library\_of\_Congress\_Classification&oldid=996406066](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Library_of_Congress_Classification&oldid=996406066) 

#### Notes

*   LCC is structured very differently from DDC. Can you imagine why, given its uses and users?
*   The article on LCC does not include information about criticisms—this does not mean that there are no criticisms!
