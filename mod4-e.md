# Key Organizations in Cataloging

Organizations are important in the development and maintenance of cataloging guidelines in the United States. Below are the names and information about some of the most prominent institutions involved in cataloging in the United States.

#### Library of Congress

Despite what a lot of people think, the Library of Congress is not technically the national library of the United States because it is designed to serve Congress as a research library. It is the de facto national library, carrying out a number of tasks expected of a national library such as working with the [copyright office](https://www.copyright.gov/) and supporting the maintenance of relevant standards (more on that later in this module).

*   **The Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC)**
    *   Overseen by the Library of Congress, is responsible for creating high-quality bibliographic content: [https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/)

#### OCLC ([https://www.oclc.org/en/home.html](https://www.oclc.org/en/home.html))

What began in the 1960s as the Ohio College Library Center and later changed to the, some said redundant, Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) before finally changing, once and for all to the initialism OCLC, OCLC has been a major player in organizing information for the past half century. OCLC began as a non-profit hosting a union catalog (or, shared catalog), available online for the academic libraries of Ohio. The services eventually expanded, and the Ohio-based shared union catalog became the international [worldcat.org](https://www.worldcat.org/) database of library holdings.

OCLC member libraries contribute catalog records to WorldCat. If a member library receives materials already described in the database, the library will _attach holdings_â€¦ all for a fee.

*   OCLC now also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification scheme: [https://www.oclc.org/en/dewey.html](https://www.oclc.org/en/dewey.html)
*   OCLC is a vendor for a number of products and services, including integrated library systems for both academic and public libraries: [https://www.oclc.org/en/services/a-z.library-management.html](https://www.oclc.org/en/services/a-z.library-management.html)
*   The research arm of OCLC carries out research on behalf of all kinds of libraries: [https://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science.htm](https://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science.html)

#### Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access (CC:DA)

Catalogers in the United States contribute to the creation and maintenance of international standards through this American Libraries Association (ALA) committee.

*   The site for the committee is located here: [https://alcts.ala.org/ccdablog/](https://alcts.ala.org/ccdablog/)
*   CC:DA is responsible for contributing to the development and maintenance of [Resource Description and Access (RDA](https://www.rdatoolkit.org/)), a cataloging standard used by libraries around the world.

Specialized communities interested in organizing materials also exist, such as [Online Audiovisual Catalogers (OLAC)](https://www.olacinc.org/), [Music Library Association (MLA),](https://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/) and the ALA ACRL [Rare Books and Manuscript Section (RBMS)](http://rbms.info/).
