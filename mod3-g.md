"International Cataloguing Principles (ICP)" (2017)
===================================================

Today, cataloging practice relies on agreed upon principles. These principles are based on Cutter's objects and the principles set forth by Cutter and other early catalogers, and have been expanded to address new categories of users and new technologies.

As a user, do you have a good sense of what modern library catalogs should be able to do? This short document, published by [IFLA](https://www.ifla.org/) (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions), covers ideas that support any catalog that might be created, anywhere around the world.

**Why are agreed upon principles important in cataloging?**

Cataloging in libraries is a collaborative practice. For example, many libraries use [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) records in their online catalogs. The bibliographic (surrogate) records in WorldCat are created by libraries from around the world. Since the records are shared, catalogers need to follow agreed upon principles that inform metadata work and system design. Archives and museums also follow shared standards, but not to the same extent as libraries whose collections often overlap with those in other libraries.  

#### Notes

*   Make sure to access the latest version.
*   Focus on the _principles._ Identify how one or two might play out in environments other than library catalogs, such as web-based retail sites.
    *   What is the role of the **user** in the system this document describes? 
*   How do these principles affect the kinds of information that are included in catalog?
*   You might notice that this document has a great glossary. If you want explanations to supplement some of the resources cited in this OER, this glossary might be a good place to look.
*   Section 6 updates Cutter's objects. 

#### **Next**

_You have looked at a number of catalogs and retrieval tools, each time with an increased level of sophistication. Next, you will continue to assess library catalogs from the perspective of IO, taking a still deeper dive into what is permitted, what is not, and why._
