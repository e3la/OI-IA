# Key Ideas in IO: Parts of a Surrogate Record

Content standards identify the metadata elements or fields included in a surrogate record. In library cataloging, surrogate records include elements that fit the following broad categories:

*   **Description:** Describe and identify the item. Some of these are included in browsable indexes. These and others may be included in keyword indexes.
*   **Access points:** Are intended for use in search and retrieval. Content is formulated according to a standard, allowing them to be retrieved and displayed together (collocated) in search results.
*   **Subject headings:** Also called Subject access points and Subject terms. Identify what the resource is about.
