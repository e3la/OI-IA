        "Building a networked web of \"data\" (notice, this term is being used in a way that is very different from the way IO defined in in the first module when the DIWK pyramid was studied!) is a challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "So much that LAMs are doing in terms of their technology relies on the success of the semantic web ideal. The descriptive cataloging standard RDA was developed to support the publication of LAM content as linked data. Yet, a critical voice might point out that LAM data, especially library data, has been siloed in MARC for generations, and moving to silo LAM data in the semantic web in the future is not an improvement. \n",
        "\n",
        "Other critical voices express concern over the problem that occurs when industry and the private sector are not invested in a technology -- until businesses are publishing their data on the semantic web, what use is it for the non-profit sector to fund the initiative? \n",
        "\n",
        "Futher complaints point to to the multiplicity of datastores, the lack of oversight and resulting redundancy, and the overall lack of cohesion of resources. \n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimagely, a lot about linked data is unknown at present. It is very promising, but the infrastructure needs to be in place for it to work. BIBFRAME seems to be somewhat stalled out at present, and RDA's promise cannot be fully realized in the current MARC environment. Where does this leave LAMs as they move forward with their technology? \n",
