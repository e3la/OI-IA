There are really two essential concepts in archives that just absolutely cannot be violated -- both of which pertain to organization, as well as to archives in general. Those two ideas are _provenance_ and _authenticity_.\r\n","\r\n","#### Provenance\r\n","\r\n","The Society of American Archivists defines [provenance](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/provenance) this way: \r\n","\r\n","> n. (provenancial, adj.) ~ 1. The origin or source of something. - 2. Information regarding the origins, custody, and ownership of an item or collection.\r\n","> \r\n","> **Notes:**\r\n","> \r\n","> Provenance1 is a fundamental principle of archives, referring to the individual, family, or organization that created or received the items in a collection. The principle of provenance or the _respect des fonds_ dictates that records of different origins (provenance) be kept separate to preserve their context.\r\n","\r\n","#### Authenticity\r\n","\r\n","With archives we need to understand that the resource is what it claims to be and that we know how we how it's come to be in this collection. That will help prove it is what it claims to be.\r\n","\r\n","The SAA defines [authenticity](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/authenticity) in the following way: \r\n","\r\n","> n. ~ 1. The quality of being genuine, not a counterfeit, and free from tampering, and is typically inferred from internal and external evidence, including its physical characteristics, structure, content, and context.\r\n","> \r\n","> **Notes:**\r\n","> \r\n","> Authenticity is closely associated with the creator (or creators) of a record. First and foremost, an authentic record must have been created by the individual represented as the creator. The presence of a signature serves as a fundamental test for authenticity; the signature identifies the creator and establishes the relationship between the creator and the record.\r\n","> \r\n","> Authenticity can be verified by testing physical and formal characteristics of a record. The ink used to write a document must be contemporaneous with the document's purported date. The style and language of the document must be consistent with other, related documents that are accepted as authentic.\r\n","> \r\n","> Authenticity alone does not automatically imply that the content of a record is reliable.  \r\n","> The authenticity of records and documents is usually presumed, rather than requiring affirmation. Federal rules of evidence stipulate that to be presumed authentic, records and documents must be created in the 'regular practice' of business and that there be no overt reason to suspect the trustworthiness of the record (Uniform Rules of Evidence, as approved July 1999).\r\n","\r\n","With archives, we need to understand that the resource is what it claims to be and that we know how we how it's come to be in this collection. That will help prove it is what it claims to be. Then and only then, we can organize it and provide access.\r\n","\r\n","**Essential Concepts in Organizing Archives**\r\n","---------------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","There's also the idea of original order, a way of organizing the collections based on how the materials came to the archives, not on any other sort of criteria like the topicality of the resource so these three principles together are really the guiding. What guides a lot of archival work and of course they all have to do with organization because we ideally need to collect records about provenance and authenticity and then we need to keep intact the original order when we're organizing in archives.\r\n","\r\n","#### **Original Order**\r\n","\r\n","Archives are interested in maintaining the _original order_, if such an order existed. SAA defines [original order](http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/o/original-order) as:\r\n","\r\n","> (also registry principle, respect for original order, _l'ordre primitif_, _respect de l'ordre intérieur_), n. ~ The organization and sequence of records established by the creator of the records.\r\n","> \r\n","> **Notes:**\r\n","> \r\n","> Original order is a fundamental principle of archives. Maintaining records in original order serves two purposes. First, it preserves existing relationships and evidential significance that can be inferred from the context of the records. Second, it exploits the record creator's mechanisms to access the records, saving the archives the work of creating new access tools.\r\n","> \r\n","> Original order is not the same as the order in which materials were received. Items that were clearly misfiled may be refiled in their proper location. Materials may have had their original order disturbed, often during inactive use, before transfer to the archives; see restoration of original order.\r\n","> \r\n","> A collection may not have meaningful order if the creator stored items in a haphazard fashion. In such instances, archivists often impose order on the materials to facilitate arrangement and description. The principle of respect for original order does not extend to respect for original chaos.\r\n","\r\n","#### **Arrangement**\r\n","\r\n","[Arrangement](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/arrangement) is how archivists talk about organizing collections. Here is SAA's definition:\r\n","\r\n","> n. ~ 1. The process of organizing materials with respect to their provenance and original order, to protect their context and to achieve physical or intellectual control over the materials. - 2. The organization and sequence of items within a collection.\r\n","> \r\n","> **Notes:**\r\n","> \r\n","> Archivist Oliver Wendell Holmes identified five levels of arrangement: repository; collection or record group; series; folder; and item. Many archives arrange records only to the folder level, although some archives arrange the items within each folder. Arrangement is often combined with the process of rehousing materials into archival containers and folders, and includes the labeling and shelving of materials. Though not widely practiced, arrangement can be employed in an intellectual sense, without a corresponding physical ordering of material. For example, five folders stored in four different boxes can be listed together in a finding aid as an ordered series without changing their storage location.\r\n","> \r\n","> Arrangement with respect to original order presumes such an order is discernable. Archivists are not required to preserve 'original chaos', and may arrange such materials in a way that facilitates their use and management without violation of any archival principle.\r\n","> \r\n","> Arrangement is distinguished from classification, which places materials in an order established by someone other than the creator.\r\n","\r\n","#### **Intellectual Control**\r\n","\r\n","All of the work that will be done is in the interest of [intellectual control](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/i/intellectual-control) (of the contents being organized). The SAA defines this as: \r\n","\r\n","> n. ~ The creation of tools such as catalogs, finding aids, or other guides that enable researchers to locate relevant materials relevant to their interests.\r\n","> \r\n","> **Notes:**\r\n","> \r\n","> Intellectual control includes exploiting access tools developed by the creator of the materials and, typically, received with the collection. However, these tools must be integrated into the repository's other tools.\r\n","\r\n","With all of these ideas in mind (plus many more!), archivists provide access to the contents of their collections using specialized tools. The most unique to archival resources is the finding aid.\r\n","\r\n","#### **Next**\r\n","\r\n","_Specific examples of retrieval tools and systems used in archives are discussed in the context of IO._"]}]}
