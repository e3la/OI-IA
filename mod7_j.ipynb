Who owns a physical object it represents? How can any of that be used? Rights metadata clarifies all this and more. \r\n",

Quite simply because users of a retrieval system must understand if the digital image they just found, for example, can be reused in their own work. What are the restrictions? Who owns the object being described? Are there copyright protections in place? Capturing all of this detail in rights metadata is incredibly complex, but absolutely essential to use.\r\n",
