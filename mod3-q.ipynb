We already know from learning about Suzanne Briet that any object that is organized and studied can be considered information, so specimens in museums (or zoos) that can teach us, and that can be organized, are worth describing here. \r\n","\r\n","Since information professionals will never organize for anything other than to promote retrieval (and to do that in conjunction with the principle of user convenience!), keeping those users in mind is important when looking to the retrieval tools in use in museums. \r\n","\r\n","Generally, both curators and museum goers part of the general public are identified as the primary users of museum collections, but sometimes experts also consult the artifacts. The retrieval tools available are different, though, based on the purpose of their use. Curators are examined first—along with the retrieval tools associated with them. \r\n","\r\n","## Organization in Museums: For Curators\r\n","\r\n","To understand the retrieval tools and contexts, understanding museum curators and the situation with museum collections is important. What _exactly_ are museum curators? The ODLIS defines [curator](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#curator)s as:\r\n","\r\n","> A person responsible for the development, care, organization, and supervision of a [museum](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#museum), gallery, or other [exhibit](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#exhibit) space and all the objects stored or displayed in it, a role requiring considerable [knowledge](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_jk.aspx#knowledge) and experience when items are selected on the basis of artistic merit or connoisseurship. Also, a person in charge of a [special collection](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#specialcollections), trained to assist users in locating and interpreting its [holdings](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_h.aspx#holdings).\r\n","\r\n","In museums, the majority of the collections will be kept in storage; for this reason it is really the museum curators (not the end users) who need to be able to _find_ resources. Retrieval tools, therefore, that support retrieval and use by the professionals working in the museum will not be resources generally available to users.\r\n","\r\n","Two primary ways to talk about retrieval tools used in museums by curators are the museum register and the museum catalog.\r\n","\r\n","#### Museum Registers\r\n","\r\n","The more simple retrieval tool of the two is the museum register. The ODLIS defines [register](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#register) a number of specialized ways, but the definition relevant to IO in museums (and records management…) is the following:\r\n","\r\n","> Also refers to a list of names, addresses, events, [date](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#date)s, etc., usually [compile](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#compile)d in a single [chronological](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#chronological) or numerical sequence and maintained as an official [log](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#logbook) or [record](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#record) (see this [19th-century example](http://www.state.de.us/sos/dpa/100/morestories/Keep'em%20leashed!.shtml), courtesy of the Delaware Public Archives). The [term](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#term) is also used for the act of recording [information](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) in such a list. **_See also_**: [civil register](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#civilregister) and [registry](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#registry).\r\n","\r\n","Museum registers are, therefore, enumerations of the artifacts owned by a museum with relevant information listed out, possibly chronologically based on when an artifact was acquired.\r\n","\r\n","#### Recorded Information about Artifacts: Preparing to Tell a Story\r\n","\r\n","Whether the entries are easily sortable or in a static list, information about museum artifacts is needed that will differ from what is needed about mass-printed library books. Basic information about what an artifact is, where it came from, and how it came into the collection are all important. This information will be used to decide about where and how to present an object in an exhibit.\r\n","\r\n","Museum curators are storytellers—they use artifacts, carefully chosen and placed, to make certain points evident to their patrons. If a curator wants to present an exhibit on a certain place during a certain period of time, all the artifacts that meet that description will need to be considered as the story the curator wishes to tell is crafted and presented.\r\n","\r\n","They often also need enough information about the object to be able to write up a brief statement that will accompany the object in the gallery, or in the other materials (both online and print) that support understanding on the part of nonspecialists.\r\n","\r\n","#### Capturing Information about Unique Artifacts\r\n","\r\n","Since museum artifacts are probably somewhat unique artifacts (compared to mass-market paperbacks, at least), additional information is needed to ensure _authenticity_, including information about _provenance_.\r\n","\r\n","[Authenticity](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/authenticity) and [provenance](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/provenance)? Or the notion that a thing is what it claims to be, and that its origins can be traced? These are terms used by archivists!\r\n","\r\n","Indeed, the convergence between the two fields is evident when considering things like (largely) unique artifacts that may be historical, and the way that institutions came to own these resources—and of course, how users will consume these materials.\r\n","\r\n","#### Legitimacy of Ownership\r\n","\r\n","Museums need to be careful not only about the authenticity of, for example, artworks (e.g., Is that _really_ a Picasso painting?) but also how the museum came to acquire it (e.g., This painting was sold by the artist at an auction.)\r\n","\r\n","Not all artworks and artifacts are legally sold, and museum professionals can sometimes be surprised to learn that artifacts where illegally sold to them, or that artifacts acquired by their predecessors actually already belong to someone else!\r\n","\r\n","Accountability is important, and the information recorded about museum artifacts for curators is very different from what librarians record about books for their users and what archivists record about their papers for their users.\r\n","\r\n","**Figure 1 Blurb, Including a Quote by Thomas Jefferson, Authored by a Museum Curator**\r\n","\r\n","![American Writers Museum (in Chicago)](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633268/preview)\r\n","\r\n","_Note._ Image is of part of Thomas Jefferson's catalog from the Massachusetts Historical Society.

Depending on the nature of the collections, materials that are part of the collection might also be housed here.\r\n","\r\n","Here, specialized users and researchers, especially, can come and learn more about the artifacts that they se seeing, or consult print-based materials. The ODLIS defines museum libraries in the following way:\r\n","\r\n","> A type of [special library](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#speciallibrary) maintained by a [museum](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#museum) or gallery, usually within its walls but sometimes in a separate location, containing a [collection](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libcollec) of [book](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#book)s, [periodical](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#periodical)s, [reproduction](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#reproduction)s, and other [materials](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libmaterials) related to its [exhibit](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#exhibit)s and [field](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#field)s of [specialization](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#specialization) (see [this example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:London-Victoria_and_Albert_Museum-Library-01.jpg)). [Access](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#access) may be by appointment only. [Borrowing privileges](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#borrowingprivileges) may be [restricted](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#restricted) to museum staff and members. Museum [librarian](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#librarian)s are organized in the [Museums, Arts, and Humanities Division](http://www.sla.org/division/dmah/) (MAHD) of the [Special Libraries Association](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#sla) (SLA).\r\n","\r\n","![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633229/download)\r\n","\r\n","An example of a museum library with a searchable online catalog is the Winterthur Museum in Winterthur, Delaware, USA: [http://www.winterthur.org/collections/library/online-catalog/ ](http://www.winterthur.org/collections/library/online-catalog/)\r\n","\r\n","Search in the Winterthur Museum catalog for information on their holdings, which include both archival holdings and other resources for specialists.\r\n","\r\n","**Presenting Artifacts: For Museum-Goers**\r\n","------------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","#### In the Museum\r\n","\r\n","In museums themselves, artifacts tend to be organized thematically and placed strategically throughout the galleries for viewing. This helps contextualize the objects for non-specialist museum-goers. As patrons move through the physical space of the museum, the story the curator is telling unfolds before them.\r\n","\r\n","#### Virtually and Online\r\n","\r\n","The perception exists that little in the way of museum content is available in digital formats. To an extent, this is true: There is less content from museums than from libraries, but digital access to museum content is not insignificant, and it is increasing all the time. A number of outstanding web sources and apps allow users to visit museums virtually, for example, and to interact with the collections and displays in ways that are completely novel.\r\n","\r\n","Museums are doing a lot with mobile technology to support and enhance physical visits. If you have been to a museum in the past couple of years you know this. Museums are helping visitors understand more deeply what they are seeing in the museum through use of their cell phones (where patrons can call a number to hear a curator describe an artifact), or with smartphones that provide additional information and images to support the story being told through the objects presented.\r\n","\r\n","Museum-goers and researchers are also increasingly able to consult museum artifacts (including ones that might not be exhibited currently) through online searchable databases that function like standard retrieval tools (with a search engine, a list of hits, records that describe artifacts more completely). In some cases, these might be publicly available versions of the museum catalog mentioned above!\r\n","\r\n","A lot is going on with 3D visualizations of artifacts and also even 3D imaging—with images accompanying the records that help users better understand the artifact and explore it as if they were physically in the same space.\r\n","\r\n","If you have not yet looked into these resources to support your understanding of these kinds of information, by all means, now is the time!\r\n","\r\n","![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633278/download)\r\n","\r\n","Many years ago, in the early aughts, the Steve project invited users to provide social tags of museum objects through a database. That project now seems to be defunct, but a new clearinghouse of sorts is available in the United States through the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA): [https://dp.la/](https://dp.la/). It is a super interface providing electronic access to the resources housed in cultural heritage centers around the US.\r\n","\r\n","Europeana ([https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en)) provides similar access to contents of many European libraries, archives, and museums. For example, a search interface has been set up to search within natural history collections: [https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/natural-history](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/natural-history) but, that is just the tip of the iceberg!\r\n","\r\n","#### In Exhibition Catalogs\r\n","\r\n","A third and final approach that can be used in museums is to create documentation of an exhibition in the form of a \"catalog\"—this kind of catalog is different from the online (or even print) catalogs we have in libraries (or even in museum libraries, as you saw above.)\r\n","\r\n","Figure 2 below is a screenshot of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York's exhibition catalogs.
