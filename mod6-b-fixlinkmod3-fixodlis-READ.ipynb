Remember back to the [Key Ideas in IO: The Elements of Library Cataloging](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-the-elements-of-library-cataloging?module_item_id=2506793) from module 3 (module 3 is where Figure 1 (reproduced below with an additional element) was introduced). \r\n","\r\n","**Figure 1 Two Main Aspects of \"Cataloging\" as Library Organization and Their Components, with Aspects Relating to Subject Cataloging Circled**\r\n","\r\n","![Chart showing library and where subject cataloging fits in](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633238/preview)\r\n","\r\n","Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) include both classification schemes and controlled vocabularies, as indicated in the image above. To revisit the discussion of KOSs from Part I, return to the page from Module 3 entitled [Key Ideas in IO: KOSs](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-koss \"Key Ideas in IO: KOSs \")\r\n","\r\n","KOSs support subject cataloging, and retrieval based on _aboutness._ How does that tie in to the image above? Simple: KOSs _ARE_ how information professionals record _aboutness_ information in surrogates.\r\n","\r\n","What does _aboutness_ mean in the context of IO and retrieval? Essentially, it is synonymous with other terms that might be more familiar to you like _topicality_ or _subject_. As with much of this, terms of art allow for unambiguous discussion of ideas that otherwise might be clouded by the way people use language informally. \r\n","\r\n","From the ODLIS, here is the definition of [_aboutness_](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#aboutness):\r\n","\r\n","> The totality of [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject)s explicitly or implicitly addressed in the [text](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#text) of a [document](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#document), including but not limited to the meaning(s) of the [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title), the stated and unstated intentions of the [author](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#author), and the ways in which the [information](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) may be used by [reader](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#reader)s. Levels of [specificity](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#specificity) must be considered in ascertaining the subject(s) of a [work](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#work). In the case of the hypothetical [title](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#title) **_The Japanese Teamwork Approach to Improving High School Effectiveness_**, is the work about:\r\n","> \r\n","> 1.  education?\r\n","> 2.  educational effectiveness?\r\n","> 3.  high school effectiveness?\r\n","> 4.  teamwork?\r\n","> 5.  a Japanese approach to teamwork?\r\n","> \r\n","> As a general rule, [catalogers](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloger) and [index](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#index)ers assign the most specific [subject headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading) that describe the significant [content](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#content) of the [item](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibitem). In a [post-coordinate](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#postcoordinate) [indexing](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#indexing) system such as the one used in the _[ERIC](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#eric)_ [database](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdatabase), the [descriptor](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descriptor)s \"Educational effectiveness,\" \"High schools,\" \"Japan,\" and \"Teamwork\" would probably be assigned to the example given above, but in a [pre-coordinate](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#precoordinate) system, such as the _[Library of Congress Subject Headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#lcshlist)_ list, the appropriate [headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_h.aspx#heading) might be \"High schools--Japan,\" \"Teacher effectiveness--Japan,\" and \"Teaching teams--Japan.\" **_See also_**: [summarization](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#summarization).\r\n","\r\n","In short, an item's _aboutness_ really is, quite simply, what it is about. Although some terms of art are not intuitive, this one is. The examples provided here use verbal subject access, but other means are available. Please note that subject headings and descriptors can take different approaches to conveying the aboutness of a resource. You will want to spend a good deal of time clicking through the hyperlinked terms in the definition until things start to make more sense. As always, you are encouraged to test all of this by opening ERIC and MU's MERLIN catalog to search for these terms. \r\n","\r\n","#### Conveying _Aboutness_ through KOSs\r\n","\r\n","In the information professions, _aboutness_ (and _isness_—or aspects relating to what an item _is,_ including its [genre](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_g.aspx#genre)) can be conveyed in the following two ways:\r\n","\r\n","*   **verbal subject access** (which is found broadly throughout retrieval systems and tools, which has correlates in Twitter and social media, and which is very intuitive).
