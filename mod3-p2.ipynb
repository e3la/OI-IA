Given the essential functions and concepts found in archives, the primary retrieval tool used in support of finding resources within the archival [fonds](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/fonds.html) is the [finding aid](https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/f/finding-aid). SAA defines them as:\r\n","\r\n","> . ~ 1. A tool that facilitates discovery of information within a collection of records. - 2. A description of records that gives the repository physical and intellectual control over the materials and that assists users to gain access to and understand the materials.\r\n","\r\n","Perhaps more interesting to students of IO is the _note_ associated with the definition. The note reads in the following way:\r\n","\r\n","> Finding aid<sup>1</sup> includes a wide range of formats, including card indexes, calendars, guides, inventories, shelf and container lists, and registers. - Finding aid<sup>2</sup> is a single document that places the materials in context by consolidating information about the collection, such as acquisition and processing; provenance, including administrative history or biographical note; scope of the collection, including size, subjects, media; organization and arrangement; and an inventory of the series and the folders.\r\n","\r\n","Physically, then, the second definition for finding aids might enumerate a series of items (e.g., correspondence) organized in numbered folders, kept in numbered boxes. The finding aid for Thomas Jefferson's papers through the Library of Congress uses slightly different wording, but shows very easily how physical correspondence is organized in a typical online finding aid: [https://findingaids.loc.gov/db/search/xq/searchMferDsc04.xq?\\_id=loc.mss.eadmss.ms008069&\\_start=63&\\_lines=125](https://findingaids.loc.gov/db/search/xq/searchMferDsc04.xq?_id=loc.mss.eadmss.ms008069&_start=63&_lines=125)\r\n","\r\n","Some in the archives world will indicate that \"archives\" must belong to an individual or family, whereas materials owned by a corporation are \"records.\" In that case, here is an example of the records of the Grenfell Press, as organized in an online finding aid through the Library of Congress: [https://findingaids.loc.gov/db/search/xq/searchMferDsc04.xq?\\_id=loc.rbc.eadrbc.rb010002&\\_start=308&\\_lines=125](https://findingaids.loc.gov/db/search/xq/searchMferDsc04.xq?_id=loc.rbc.eadrbc.rb010002&_start=308&_lines=125)\r\n","\r\n","#### **Next**\r\n","\r\n","_Continuing the discussion of IO in LAMs, the focus of the next page is on IO in museums._"]}]}
