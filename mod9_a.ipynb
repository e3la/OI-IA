        "In the last Module, you learned more specifics about library catalogs—or catalogs of materials in any number of information agencies. Catalogs are far from being monolithic, yet certain characteristics are essential for a library catalog to be a catalog in the online environment. Digital libraries, however, can vary vastly from one installation to the next. Context including the digital content, users, infrastructure, staffing, etc. can lead to different decisions about the best way to organize and present content in these environments.\n",

        "Many of these digital library environments tend to be overseen in academic and special libraries by information professionals who go by the title \"metadata librarian\" or \"digital librarian\"—as you read this Module, notice how digital library work is similar to but also different from the work done by cataloging librarians who maintain online catalogs."
