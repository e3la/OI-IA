# History of Information (Norman, n.d.)

This very readable overview of centuries of history in IO, primarily in the West, draws heavily from published resources. This piece is not the definitive history of the field and is not scholarly, but rather should be seen as a good jumping off point for learning about the big topics before taking a deeper dive.

> Norman, J.  (n.d.). 3. From cuneiform archives to A.I. applications: The development of bibliographical control, indexing and searching (pp. 107–128). _HistoryofInformation.com_. [http://www.historyofinformation.com/narrative/index.php](http://www.historyofinformation.com/narrative/index.php)

#### Notes

A number of these topics were already introduced in the module on retrieval, but as you learned, the history of organization predates that of retrieval. 

*   What do you see in here that complements something you already knew?
*   What is most surprising?
*   What would you like to investigate further?
*   Having read about Aristotle's Opera, look at a digitized version of it and the record for it from the Morgan Library & Museum

While you do not need to examine the information in detail, spend some time exploring the time frames and developing an understanding of how the documentation and organization of information has changed over time. Make a list of five changes or transitions.
