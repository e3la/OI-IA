        "This module is about library information on the web and, conversely, how libraries can leverage internet technologies to re-use date published elsewhere and share data. This goes well beyond (hyper)linking from one webpage to another, which is a signature feature of html hyperlinks like the ones used extensively in this OER. Rather, with linked data, the focus is on taking data from different data sources and integrating it with other data. One way this can play out is on a web page. Figures 1 and 2, below, highlight the differences between linking to webpages and linked data. An important concept in linked data is \"reuse.\" Linked data technologies make use of structured data that can be reused in multiple web applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "> In addition to the classic “Web of documents” W3C is helping to build a technology stack to support a “Web of data,” the sort of data you find in databases. The ultimate goal of the Web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The term “Semantic Web” refers to W3C’s vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. (W3C)\n",

To make the Web of Data a reality, it is important to have the huge amount of data on the Web available in a standard format, reachable and manageable by Semantic Web tools. Furthermore, not only does the Semantic Web need access to data, but _relationships among data_ should be made available, too, to create a _Web_ of Data (as opposed to a sheer collection of datasets). This collection of interrelated datasets on the Web can also be referred to as Linked Data.\n",
