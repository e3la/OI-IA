# Other Key Players

In the last lecture,  Callimachus, the first cataloger, was presented, along with some notions about how little is actually known about the organization at the ancient Library of Alexandria.

_Which other historical figures are important to the history of IO in the West?_ 

## Wikipedia Articles for Some Key Players in Organization of Information

*   **Anthony Panizzi,** (16 September 1797 – 8 April 1879), the Keeper of the Printed Books of the British Museum Library.
    *   Author of the 91 rules—the first set of official rules of how to catalog. 
    *   Italian political refugee in England.
    *   Read more about him: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony\_Panizzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Panizzi)

        *   This outlined, among others, the "Objects of a Dictionary Catalog"—in other words, what a catalog should permit users to do.
        *   Cutter was very pro-user; in fact, he is behind the _principle of user convenience_ covered earlier in this class.
    *   Devised author numbers that were used in call numbers.
    *   All-around library thinker.

She became the first African-American woman to hold the position of dean at UMC when she assumed the position of Dean of SLIS in 1984. Mary Lenox served as Dean until June 1, 1996, when the independent School of Library and Informational Science was administratively placed under the College of Education and retitled the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies" (Unions' Arts, 2015, Section "School Officials Who Broke the Color Barrier" para. 2).

    *   Although Dean Lenox was not specifically involved in IO, she lead a program that prepared well-rounded information professionals... just like you!

        *   Her impressive credentials and achievements are described in the post above.
