IO is a field in library and information science (LIS). \n","\n","IO occupies a singularly unique place in LIS. But first, what is _library science_? And what is _information science_? How did the two come together?\n","\n","_And more importantly to this class, how does that relate to IO?_ \n","\n","## Library Science, In Broad Strokes\n","\n","Many students who find their way into IO classes want to be librarians or information professionals of some kind or another. Library science is the field in which librarians work. The ODLIS defines [library science](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libraryscience) in the following way:\n","\n","> The professional [knowledge](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_jk.aspx#knowledge) and skill with which [record](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_r.aspx#record)ed [information](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) is [selected](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#selection), [acquired](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#acquisitions), organized, stored, maintained, retrieved, and disseminated to meet the needs of a specific clientele, usually taught at a professional library school qualified to grant the postbaccalaureate degree of [M.L.S.](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mls) or [M.L.I.S.](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#mlis) The term is used synonymously in the United States with [librarianship](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#librarianship). Compare with [information science](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#infoscience).\n","\n","A librarian's work extends well beyond IO, but IO is an essential function of what libraries do and what they offer. Library science grows from a tradition of working with published print resources, namely books. In the final Module in this Part of class, you will learn about the history of IO in libraries, and you will see how much of it relates to organizing books in formal libraries.\n","\n","Connecting Modern Library Science to the Humanities and the Social Sciences\n","\n","Libraries are not warehouses for books, though! They are much more -- and when libraries are organized well, they ultimately serve their users. \n","\n","*   Since the historic focus of libraries is **books,** a close association exists between libraries/library science and literature and literary studies, as well as with history.\n","    *   As such, library science has close ties to the **[humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities).** \n","*   Library science addresses users and their information needs, and how users go about meeting those information needs.\n","    *   Such topics are addressed in the **[social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science),** meaning there is also a strong emphasis on the social sciences in library science. \n","\n","All of this implies that libraries are historically tied to books, to academics, to the study of human artifacts (i.e., humanities) and to the study of the users who use libraries (i.e., social sciences).\n","\n","For the moment, this might seem somewhat comprehensive. Libraries do a lot! What can possibly be missing from that definition so for? Yet, the ODLIS definition above invited readers to compare _library science_ with _information science_. \n","\n","## Information Science, Writ Large\n","\n","Information science studies information, a topic discussed in the last Module. The ODLIS defines [information science](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#infoscience) as:\n","\n","> The systematic study and analysis of the sources, development, collection, organization, dissemination, evaluation, use, and management of [information](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#information) in all its forms, including the channels (formal and informal) and [technology](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#it) used in its communication. Compare with [informatics](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#informatics) and [library science](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#libraryscience). **_See also_**: [information theory](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#informationtheory).\n","\n","### **ASIST**\n","\n","The Association for Information Science & Technology (ASIST) is the premiere scholarly society focusing on research in LIS. ASIST provides a number of compelling definitions of [information science ](https://www.asist.org/about/what-is-information-science/)on its website.\n","\n","Considered this way, information science focuses on the resources (e.g., textual and non-textual resources) and the technology used to store and retrieve them. Often, information science focuses on documents, including electronic documents and articles.\n","\n","According to the ODLIS definition, **organization** is one of the processes under study in information science!\n","\n","## Documentalism: Information Science's Origins\n","\n","Intuitively, the origins of library science are clear -- logically, those working in libraries began to study the best way to carry out their work. The origins of information science are a bit more opaque, however. How did a study of \"information\" possibly get started?\n","\n","Information science began as a field known as \"documentalism\" or \"document science.\" Wikipedia's entry on Documentation science is a great starting point: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation\\_science.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_science)\n","\n","[Suzanne Briet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Briet) (about whom both Buckland and Glushko wrote — the one interested in antelopes) is associated with the [documentalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_science) movement, a tradition that is alive and well in a number of parts of the world, but less so, perhaps, in the English-speaking areas.\n","\n","Document science is the study of documents. Wikipedia states:\n","\n","> [**Documentation science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_science) is the study of the [recording](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recording \"wikt:recording\") and [retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval \"Information retrieval\") of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information \"Information\").[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_science#cite_note-1) Documentation science gradually developed into the broader field of [information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science \"Information science\").\n","\n","Documentalism is seen to provide access to the article-length resource, to newspaper articles, to grey literature and reports, etc. Traditionally, then, libraries were the domain of books, and other text-based resources were traditionally thought of as documents. These resources are still published, and high quality and part of the formal, traditional scholarly communication ecosystem, but they are generally produced more quickly than books, and are shorter, meaning they are much more easily digitized.\n","\n","## Situating LIS as the Intellectual Home to IO\n","\n","By the 1980s, library science and information science  were seen as complementary; arguably, an understanding of both is necessary to work in any modern information environment. The two fields were merged and LIS emerged.\n","\n","Because IO in information agencies is both the way books and documents/other kinds of information are organized, because IO makes use of technology and standards, and is a service to support users, it is in many ways not only a pillar of library science but also a crucial aspect of information science. Therefore, learning about library science and related information science aspects are essential to understanding how IO works.\n","\n","```{admonition} Library Science or Information Science?\n","You might ask your professors which they consider to be the overarching field: Library science or information science. Those who are more interested in history and philosophy might consider library science to be the overarching field, but increasingly, researchers consider information science to be the overarching discipline and library science to be one of many sub-areas of research. Professors like to argue about these topics endlessly! You are likely studying to be a practitioner—so the most important question remains: What do YOU think? And how are you approaching your studies?\n","```\n","\n","#### **Next**\n","\n","_This module turns its focus to information retrieval and the tools that information professionals and users employ to find information resources that are available. Retrieval has its roots in information science, and because IO is concerned about users finding resources, it is an essential next topic to study in learning about IO._"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zxaiEdtKvcmz"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
