Key Ideas in IO: The Catalog and Cutter's Objects
=================================================

A library catalog has been described as a primary retrieval system in libraries. But, what is the point of a catalog, anyway?

**The Functions of Catalogs**
-----------------------------

The primary functions of library catalogs are to help users, both a community of users and information professionals, search the collection for a known item or for items by subject. In this case, the user already knows the name of the author and/or the title of the item, or has identified a topic of interest. In their searches, users hope to bring together everything in the collections based on the search (i.e., to collocate based on author, title, or topic), and then to evaluate what they find. You will find these ideas presented below.

A modern formal definition of [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx) can be found on the ODLIS.

### **Charles Ammi Cutter**

Charles Ammi Cutter's name will appear several times throughout this class. Curious to know more? The Wikipedia entry on Cutter is a great place to start: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles\_Ammi\_Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ammi_Cutter)

These "objects" (today, they would likely be called "objectives") of the catalog were written over 100 years ago by Charles Ammi Cutter, and were a first and very influential attempt at describe the functions of a catalog, so as to identify what needed to be included in surrogate records. This allowed librarians to work backwards and to devise rules about the content they would provide in surrogate records.

**Choice of Content in Bibliographic Records**
----------------------------------------------

The list of objectives devised by Cutter might seem limited today. Why were librarians initially so hesitant to include too much information in a catalog card? Several very practical reasons guide this work:

*   Catalog cards needed to include just enough to meet the needs presented
    *   Too much information took too much time for the cataloger to supply.
        *   The more information there was, the greater the chance for mistakes.
    *   Too much information would not fit on a single card catalog card. Catalog cards are quite small, really.

Information professional found that focusing on the aspects laid out in Cutter's objectives was sufficient, and the objectives guided information professionals for a century.

**Cutter's Objects and Implications for Catalogs**
--------------------------------------------------

Cutter's objects had implications for the functionality of catalogs, whether they were print catalogs or online catalogs. The table below shows some of the implications for the design of the catalog and the content of the surrogate record. Some of the functions listed for systems were not available in card catalogs.
