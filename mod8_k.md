"Integrated Library System" (Wikipedia, 2021)
=============================================

> Integrated library system. (2021, January 3). In _Wikipedia._ [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integrated\_library\_system&oldid=997981562](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integrated_library_system&oldid=997981562)Â 

#### Notes

*   This is a short Wikipedia article on integrated library systems and their predecessors. The most interesting part is the history of catalogs by decade.
*   Another useful term: Turnkey system.
    *   Wikipedia defines "Turnkey" as "a type of project that is constructed so that it can be sold to any buyer as a completed product." ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnkey))
    *   In reference to an ILS, this means that the system comes ready for use, though usually different features can be customized. This is the same concept as "out of the box."

_This module has looked closely at the back-end decisions and work carried out in libraries as it pertains to the online catalog. Next, explore an integrated library system (ILS), from the public point of view._
