Subject Heading Lists and Thesauri Examples and Pre- and Post-Coordination
==========================================================================

As mentioned briefly in the beginning of this Module, subject heading lists provide **verbal subject access**—they are examples of controlled vocabularies. In addition, thesauri of indexing terms are also controlled vocabularies.

**Subject Heading Lists**
-------------------------

Subject headings are organized in lists. Why lists? That is discussed in the next page. For now, understand that these lists (which are increasingly electronic and searchable through databases) organize the subject headings and the long strings of additional information that can be appended to form those long strings. 

From the ODLIS, the entry for [subject heading](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading): 

> The most specific word or [phrase](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#phrase) that describes the [subject](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject), or one of the subjects, of a [work](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_w.aspx#work), selected from a list of [preferred terms](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#preferredterm) ([controlled vocabulary](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#controlled)) and assigned as an [added entry](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#addedentry) in the [bibliographic record](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord) to serve as an [access point](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accesspoint) in the [library](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) [catalog](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#catalog). A subject heading may be [subdivided](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subdivision) by the addition of [subheadings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subheading) (_example_: **Libraries--History--20th century**) or include a [parenthetical qualifier](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#parenthetical) for [semantic](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#semantics) clarification, as in **Mice (Computers)**. The use of [cross-references](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#crossreference) to indicate [semantic relations](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#semanticrelation) between subject headings is called [syndetic structure](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#syndetic). The process of examining the [content](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#content) of new [publications](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#publication) and assigning appropriate subject headings is called [subject analysis](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectanalysis). In the United States, most libraries use [Library of Congress subject headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#lcsh) (LCSH), but [small libraries](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#smalllibrary) may use [Sears subject headings](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#sears). Compare with [descriptor](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descriptor). **_See also_**: [aboutness](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#aboutness) and [summarization](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#summarization).

Subject headings are ubiquitous in the information professions. 

#### Common Subject Heading Lists

*   [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)—Library of Congress Subject Headings
*   [Sears List of Subject Headings](https://www.hwwilsoninprint.com/sears.php) (generally used in schools and small public libraries)
*   [MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search)—Medical Subject Headings
*   [FAST](http://fast.oclc.org/searchfast/)\--Faceted Application of Subject Terminology (generally used in digital libraries)

Each of these subject heading lists has its own rules for application. Once the information agency makes the decision to use the subject heading list, the rules have to be followed in creating and assigning the subject headings.

**Thesauri**
------------

This OER introduced the term _thesaurus_ (the plural is "thesauri") back in Module 3 when discussing principles of retrieval.

Generally, thesauri are more specialized in scope than subject heading lists, whereas subject heading lists are generally more universal.

How else are thesauri different from subject heading lists? TA few ways. For example, thesauri include descriptors and provide for their use by information intermediaries, who will apply them to surrogate records for items, usually articles or electronic content. Generally, whereas catalogers apply subject heading in library environments, indexers will supply descriptors in database environments.

The ODLIS defines [descriptors](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descriptor) in the following way:

> In [indexing](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#indexing), a [preferred term](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#preferredterm), [notation](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_n.aspx#notation), or sequence of [symbol](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#symbol)s assigned as an [access point](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accesspoint) in the [bibliographic record](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibrecord) representing a [document](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#document) to indicate one of the [subjects](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject) of its [text](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#text) ([synonym](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#synonym)ous in [library](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#library) [cataloging](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#cataloging) with the [term](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#term) [subject heading](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading)). In [bibliographic databases](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx#bibdatabase), descriptors appear in the DE or SUBJECT [field](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_f.aspx#field) of the record. [Major descriptors](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#major) are distinguished from [minor descriptors](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#minor) by a [special character](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#specialcharac), usually the [asterisk](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#asterisk). Some [abstracting and indexing](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#abstractingand) services, such as _[ERIC](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_e.aspx#eric)_ and _Psychological Abstracts_, provide a list of authorized indexing terms in the form of a [printed](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_p.aspx#printing) or [online](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#online) [thesaurus](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx#thesaurus). Compare with [identifier](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx#identifier). **_See also_**: [aboutness](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#aboutness), [controlled vocabulary](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#controlled), and [descriptor group](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descriptorgroup).

Descriptors used in indexing can also be selected from thesauri, especially specialized ones that only cover one domain (like art, for example). The use of thesaurus descriptors is common in article databases like ERIC.

#### Common Thesauri

*   [FAST](http://fast.oclc.org/searchfast/)—Faceted Application of Subject Terminology—is technically a thesaurus. FAST is used in libraries.
*   [Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms](https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/training/thesaurus)

**Taking a Closer Look**

Review the Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH) record for [Children.](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85023418.html)Note terms under: Variants, Narrower Terms, and Broader Terms. What is the benefit in a library catalog? Easy! If your library's patron searches one of the Variants, many online catalogs will point the user to the authorized form of the heading (in this case, Children). Example: Try it for yourself! Pretend you are an end-user looking for books about "people from birth through twelve years of age" so you spontaneously do a [MERLIN search for Childhood](http://merlin.lib.umsystem.edu/search/?searchtype=d&SORT=D&searcharg=childhood&searchscope=8). The authorized LCSH term is Children, but Childhood is a Variant!!! In MERLIN, you will be directed to the hyperlink Children, to re-launch the search using the authorized term. Can this be right?? But yes! At the top, you see the scope note, which gives guidance on use of the subject term: Here are entered works on people from birth through twelve years of age.

**Pre-Coordinated or Post-Coordinated?**
----------------------------------------

#### Pre-Coordinated Terms

Subject headings are unique in the world of controlled vocabularies because they permit long strings of terms to be added together in a single heading. Subdivisions can be added to headings following a long series of rules and standards that are available. Why do this? Simple: in the days of paper card catalog cards, having as many terms in the heading as possible was a good idea. This is called "pre-coordinated" because more than one idea present.

NISO (2010) defines precoordination as:

> The formulation of a multiword heading or the linking of a heading and subheadings to create a formally controlled, multi-element expression of a concept or object. Precoordination is often used to ensure logical sorting of related expressions. Examples of precoordinated headings:
> 
> New England—Genealogy—Handbooks, Manuals, etc.
> 
> Searching, Bibliographic
> 
> United States—History—Civil war, 1861–1865
> 
> See also _postcoordination_" (p. 8).

In summary, pre-coordinated controlled vocabulary terms include more than one idea (e.g., cats that are afraid of vacuum cleaners). LCSH and other subject heading lists are notoriously able to accommodate pre-coordinated terms through subdivisions.

#### Post-Coordinated Terms

In the era of electronic-based retrieval, terms ideally represent only a single idea. End-users will then take advantage of advanced search strategies to identify all the terms they need. This is considered to be a "post-coordinated" approach because after the surrogate is created and single-idea terms are applied, the user will post-hoc construct the search.

In other words, post-coordinated terms only include one idea each (e.g., vacuum cleaners; fear; cats). An index can contain both kinds of terms, as can a subject heading list. These kinds of approaches are much more frequently associated with thesauri, however. due to their nature.

NISO (2010) defines postcoordination as:

> The combining of terms at the searching stage rather than at the subject heading list construction state or indexing stage. See also _precoordination"_ (p. 7).

NISO (2010) document on thesaurus construction describes these two ideas quite well:

> "As a general principle of vocabular control, terms _should_ represent single concepts, expressed by a single word or by a multiword term unless it is a precoordinated terms" (p. 36). Refer to page 37 for a rundown of other aspects relating to pre- and post-coordinated terms, including retrieval considerations.

#### **Next**

_Thesauri might not be as familiar a concept as subject headings. The next page gives you the opportunity to explore a well-known thesaurus as an information intermediary might while carrying out the cataloging task._
