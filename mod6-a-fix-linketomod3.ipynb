Subject Access and Categorization\r\n","======================================================\r\n","\r\n","Subject Access and Categorization\r\n","=================================\r\n","\r\n","Module 5 focused on metadata in general and on descriptive metadata in particular. Descriptive metadata _describes_ an object, and can include information such as a title, the name of the author, publication information, what the object is, and what it is about. \r\n","\r\n","_Descriptive cataloging_ (or _description_) is one aspect of descriptive metadata. \r\n","\r\n","This Module focuses on the other main aspect of descriptive metadataâ€”that of the topicality, and how information professionals apply consistent approaches to supplying that terminology or to organizing material based on what it is about. \r\n","\r\n","**![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633283/download)Learning Objectives**\r\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","After completing this module, you will be able to:\r\n","\r\n","*   explain what subject access is and how it supports discovery and access. \r\n","*   Identify standards used in subject cataloging including controlled vocabularies and classification schemes used in libraries. \r\n","\r\n","**![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633254/download)Essential Questions**\r\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n","\r\n","*   What is subject access in retrieval systems and how does it function?\r\n","*   What metadata supports subject access and how is it created?\r\n","*   Who uses subject access, and how?\r\n","*   What benefits does verbal subject access have for users?\r\n","*   How do information professionals use controlled vocabularies when providing access?\r\n","\r\n","![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/files/8633221/download)\r\n","\r\n","**Rationale**\r\n","-------------\r\n","\r\n","Descriptive cataloging involves adding descriptive metadata to a surrogate record. Thinking back to Cutter's Objects (for a Dictionary Catalog) (remember from Module 3: _[Key Ideas in IO: The Catalog and Cutter's Objects](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/49361/pages/key-ideas-in-io-the-catalog-and-cutters-objects \"Key Ideas in IO: The Catalog and Cutter's Objects\")_), descriptive information is useful in identification and selection of an information resource.\r\n","\r\n","What about finding based on what a thing is _about_? That was also part of Cutter's Objects. It is also an important part of searching for resources.\r\n","\r\n","If you have a background in language arts (or are just a fan of languages) you probably realize that language that expresses ideas can be very, very messy. Words can mean a lot of different things, in different contexts, to different people. How can information professionals describe resources in ways that allow users to find every resource they seek on a topic?"]}]}
