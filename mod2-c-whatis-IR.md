# What Is Information Retrieval and Where Does It Take Place?

**First, the basics. Information retrieval is also known as _IR_.** IR targets how users access the materials (both physical and digital) housed in an information agency. 

This quote about information retrieval from a classic textbook on the topic shows how broad the concept of retrieval is: 

> Information retrieval (IR) deals with the representation, storage, organization of, and access to information items. ... the user must first translate \[an\] information need into a _query_ which can be processed by the search engine (or IR system). ... Given the user query, the key goal of an IR system is to retrieve information which might be useful or relevant to the user. (Baeza-Yates & Ribiero-Neto, 1999, p. 1 (or here: [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/1/node2.html](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/1/node2.html)))

Retrieval is not just about typing search terms into a catalog and studying the results. The close relationship between the organization of information and its retrieval is evident in this quote. These days, considering one without the other does not make sense. This has not always been the case, though. 

The focus on information retrieval heralds a new era in the organization of information:

> The term ‘information retrieval’ was coined in 1952 and gained popularity in the research community from 1961 onwards. At that time the organizing function of information retrieval was seen as a major advance in libraries that were no longer just storehouses of books, but also places where the information they hold is catalogued and indexed. (Chowdhury, 2010, p. 1)

Once cataloged and indexed, the content in an information agency can be retrieved by users, either with the help of information professionals or, increasingly, on their own using retrieval systems. As Baeza-Yates and Ribiero-Neto (1999) mention, libraries were among the first institutions to make IR systems available. This was prior to the advent of the web, of course.

```{note}
If you realize information retrieval is of interest to you, there are classes and books that focus on information retrieval. Much of the content of the information retrieval textbook mentioned is freely available online: [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/) and is a great place to start, especially if you already have a background in computer science or cognition—or library systems!
```

Retrieval takes place in well-defined environments that grew out of the need to support users. A number of well-known systems emerged, most notably, perhaps, the **catalog**. The catalog, however, is not the only system in which organization and retrieval takes place, and it certainly was not the first.

#### **Next**

_As you may imagine, information retrieval has a long and storied history—almost as long as organization! Once collections got too large for a single individual to know where things were, other systems of retrieval became critical. The next **three** pages look at some of this history, with a focus on some of the tools used historically and currently in the organization of information._
