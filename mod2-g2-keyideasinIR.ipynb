The next few pages in this module present a number of key ideas and terms that are instrumental. \n","\n","Be sure to read the definitions, click on the examples, and make sure you understand these complex topics before moving on. \n","\n","## Information Retrieval\n","\n","In libraries and archives information retrieval is the act of searching for known items in a catalog, index or database. Some retrieval tools are analog, and some are digital. Computer-based information storage and retrieval systems, such as a librarie's OPAC (online public access catalog) are designed for convience and effectiveness balanced with speed, accuracy and cost.\n","\n","In the information professions, the focus in IR tends to be on databases such as library catalogs or digital repositories. Information professionals, however, need to understand how IR works in general, including on the web. After all, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) is a database.\n","\n","## Databases\n","                                                                                                                    \n","Databases are software -- often hosted in the cloud and available through the Web -- that contain searchable information. Wikipedia describes [Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) as follows:\n","\n","> A **database** is an organized collection of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) \"Data (computing)\"), generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.\n","\n","Many of the databases used in the information professions are relational databases, with very specific ways for accessing and searching the content, and with specific kinds of information contained within. Wikipedia describes [Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) this way: \n","\n","> A **relational database** is a digital [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database \"Database\") based on the [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model \"Relational model\") of data, as proposed by [E. F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Codd \"E. F. Codd\") in 1970.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#cite_note-codd-1) A software system used to maintain relational databases is a [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system \"Relational database management system\") (RDBMS). Many relational database systems have an option of using the [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL \"SQL\") (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#cite_note-2)\n","\n","The whole idea of \"query\" is important in this context. In fact, that is one aspect essential to databases—they can be queried. Follow this link to read about three primary ways a database can be queried: [https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/query.html](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Q/query.html)\n","\n","```{admonition} Amazon:\n","To use [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as an example, the database is the system that users query to find out if a certain book or product is available for purchase.\n","```\n","\n","#### Databases in LIS\n","\n","Those were some rather technical, computer-science-oriented explanations in Wikipedia and the Webopedia. In librarianship the term database often refers to digital information, including but not limited to bibliographic records, abstracts, directories, images and full-text repositories. Often databases are on a specific subjects (such as psychology / APA Psych Info) and consit of records of a uniform format. Some databases contain periodical indexes, catalogs, and/or full-text collections which are often annually licesed by the library and accessible only by known members of the library.\n","\n","Databases in LIS are usually available through the web, are maintained by the library, by a vendor, etc., and contain organized collections of resources. They are searchable using information _about_ those resources. \n","\n","#### **Next**\n","\n","_Retrieval environments maintained by information professionals are often different from ones that you may be used to using. The goals of information professionals, after all, are not to sell anyone anything, but rather to serve their users in a way that is both professional and ethical. Remember, for example, the American Library Association (ALA) [Code of Ethics](http://www.ala.org/tools/ethics). Next, you will spend at least five minutes looking through an online database of scholarly and other content relating to the field of education._"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"E6sp1xhtvkT0"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
