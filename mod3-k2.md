Key Ideas in IO: The Elements of Library Cataloging
===================================================

A number of the IO-related concepts can most neatly be contextualized in relation to library cataloging.

This is not to say that these processes only apply to the creation of bibliographic records that describe materials in library collections! For the sake of providing concrete examples right now, this Module chooses to simplify and look at these idea within that very precise environment: library cataloging and classification.

![Hierarchy of Library Cataloging](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/45003/files/7748335/download)









At the top of this figure is library organization. Ultimately, in libraries, this is the work that information professionals carry out in cataloging. There are two main aspects to cataloging: Descriptive cataloging and subject cataloging. 

**Descriptive Cataloging**
--------------------------

In the above diagram, to the left is the work the information intermediary does that relates to the physical container (e.g., the book itself) and what is written there. Think back to the catalog records in MERLIN you just examined. Much of the information there described the books based on what the book looked like (e.g., number of pages, if there are illustrations, if there is an index) and the words written on the book (e.g., the name of the author, the title of the book, the name of the publisher, etc.)

This is descriptive cataloging. Descriptive cataloging does not include assigning subject headings or genre terms. The rules to descriptive cataloging in the US, UK and Canada have long (going back to 1908) been governed by AACR (Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules), and were superceeded by RDA (Resource Description and Access) in the beginning of the 21st century. 

Review the ODLIS definition of [descriptive cataloging](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#descripcatalog).
 
Under **descriptive cataloging** in the figure above are two parts: Description and access. Both of these tasks are mentioned in the definition in the ODLIS. Nonetheless, looking specifically at each makes sense. 

#### Description

With _description_, the cataloger will describe the physical or electronic container that houses the intellectual content. Is this a book with 280 pages? A PDF? A streaming audio file? How does the title appear on the resource? How is the publisher's name written? What date was this published? If you have the physical item in your hand, you can answer these questions and record or transcribe the data. 

#### Access

Information intermediaries also create access points in the bibliographic record based on what they see written on the resource. Access points are highly structured content provided in specific fields of the bibliographic record that allow for really high-quality search. Review the ODLIS definition of
[Access points.](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#accesspoint)

Access points can include the form of a person's name as established by catalogers. Did you ever wonder how those last-name-first forms of names found their way into library catalogs? A cataloger looked at the resource, looked up the name, and added it.

The same is done for titles. The cataloger goes from what is written on the book, and supplied the title in a standard way. The same is true for series title information, etc.!

**Subject Cataloging**
----------------------

The right-hand side of the figure above provides information about **subject cataloging.**

Subject cataloging is based on the intellectual contents of the resource—so what the resource is _about._ Review the ODLIS definition for [subject](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subject).

The subject can best be understood as the topic and themes of a work, both as understood explicitly from the text and implicitly in its message. Often books are assigned one or more sujects headings for the purposes of access, to help patrons discover material by topic.  

Figuring out the subject of a resource requires the information professional to carry out a subject analysis process.

After that, the information professional can assign subject headings or other controlled vocabulary terms that permit verbal subject access. They can also provide classification notation based on the [aboutness](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_a.aspx#aboutness)—this will allow for the resource to be physically collocated with other resources on the same topic in an open stacks environment.

When people think about stereotypical aspects of library organization, then seem to think of Dewey Decimal Classification, and most also seem to be familiar with Library of Congress Subject Headings. Let us dig in to know what they _are_, and how do they relate to IO.

#### Verbal Subject Access

Library of Congress Subject Headings are an example of **verbal subject access** included in bibliographic records. What does **verbal subject access** mean?

In this case, verbal means word-based. In libraries, the information intermediaries will provide verbal (i.e., word-based) subject access using a controlled vocabulary (a kind of KOS)-often a subject heading list.

Subject heading are used extensively when doing research in libraries. Review the ODLIS definition [subject heading](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_s.aspx#subjectheading).

A subject heading is often a phrase, sometimes just a word that describes the subject of a work, from a list of preferred terms. Subject headings are access points in the library catalog. Subject headings are often hierarchical, subdivided by additional subheadings. For example Libraries--History--20th century. Semantic clarifications are sometimes provided, such as Mice (Computers). Examining the content of a work and assigning appropriate subject headings is called subject analysis. Many academic libraries use LCSH (Library of Congress Subject Headings) some small libraries use Sears subject headings.

LCSH is a subject heading list. In its original printed form, it was a book of alphabetically listed subjects that books can be about. Very strict rule exist for applying them, and they are surprisingly tricky to learn to create! The following complex headings are "established" but often, the cataloger will need to read the instructions and figure out how to string all the terms together themselves.

[Flamenco music--History and criticism](https://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=7441788&v1=1&HC=1&SEQ=20200827185116&PID=Zp076hDypyVgRR9CumhiC1RFWiK)

[Noise control--Law and legislation--Germany (West)](https://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=8195387&v1=1&HC=1&SEQ=20200827185159&PID=qfELtPnaXaD54cP1W1xkEA2FBDo)

[Knitting--Fiction](https://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=7527398&v1=1&HC=1&SEQ=20200827185258&PID=k0qZGzYjbHeS4K3x4F1jsftcN-c)

#### Classification Notation and Classification Schemes

Dewey Decimal Classification, arguably the quintessential library organization scheme, is a classification scheme that uses numbers (and a decimal) in the notation.

The _aboutness_ of a resource was already the basis for the LCSH terms, but it will also be the basis for another kind of subject-based access: the classification and ultimately, the [call number](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#callnumber) which will dictate where the book sits on the shelf.

Think about it: how are libraries organized? They always put like things together, generally based on topic. This is very different from the way that archives organize, and also can be different from the way museums present content.

Not all library resources will be classified (e.g., media like video games are often just given accession numbers), but if resources are classified, they will be assigned a **classification notation** from the scheme in use.

In most libraries in the U.S. and Canada, the classification scheme used is either [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d.aspx#dewey) (DDC) or [Library of Congress Classification](https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_l.aspx#lcclassification) (LCC). 

_Notation_?

Notations are symbols combined according to syntatical rules. Numbers, letters and punctuation helpful for arranging books on shelves, browsing by subject and displaying items in an online catalog. For a deep dive into notation check out the ISKO Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization article [Notation by Claudio Gnoli](https://www.isko.org/cyclo/notation) (optional reading).
