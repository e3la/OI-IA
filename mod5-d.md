# "Metadata and the Web" (Gill, 2016)

Read about metadata and the web in this chapter from the edited book entitled _Introduction to Metadata._

> Gill, T. (rev. by Baca, M. with assistance from Cobb, J, Deines, N. & Kim, M.) (2016). Metadata and the web. In M. Baca (Ed.), _Introduction to metadata_ (3rd ed.). The Getty Research Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/metadata-and-the-web/](http://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/metadata-and-the-web/)

From the Introduction: Chapter 2 focuses on metadata as it relates to resources on the web. We explain how web search engines work and how they use metadata, data, links, and relevance ranking to help users find what they are seeking.  We also discuss in detail the commercial search engine that, as of this writing, has dominated the web for several years: Google. ( . . . ) How library metadata behaves in the era of Google dominance is also addressed.

#### Notes

*   This reading gives an interesting overview of searching on the web, the proliferation of documents accessible via searches, and the challenges in finding "relevant, authoritative, high-quality information."
*   A section in this chapter is titled, "Metadata to the rescue?" After reading the chapter, how do you answer that question? Does metadata provide a solution that overcomes the weaknesses of keyword searching in Google?

#### **Next**

_Next, another chapter from this book directs the focus of this module to metadata in LAMs._
