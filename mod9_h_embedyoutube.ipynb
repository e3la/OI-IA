        "*   Even when multiple agencies adopt the same standard, local adaptations will lead to differences in what agencies do, so application profiles can help in these situations. They are a way to record choices related to the local application of metadata, can be used to develop a consensus about metadata, and tell consumers of the metadata what to expect.\n",
