# Callimachus: Legend of IO in the West

The history of organization of information is arguably as longstanding as the information professions and the field itself. How much is really known, though, about its origins? Take Callimachus, for example. He is the legendary cataloger of antiquity, but about whom very little is known. This lecture looks at the little that is known, reviews what is not known, and summarizes its conclusions. 
## The Legacy of Callimachus

[Callimachus of Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callimachus) (pronounced /cuh-lim-uh-kus/) is credited in LIS texts as being the first cataloger (e.g., Casson, 2002; Chan & Salaba, 2016; Joudrey & Taylor, 2018; Pomerantz, 2015). But does this mean that he carried out the same kind of work that catalogers do today? Not exactly, but unfortunately, many of the details have been lost to history. Much about Callimachus and his contribution has been pieced together over the years, with Callimachus emerging as a legend in library mythology.

The story of Callimachus centers on the problem of organizing the enormous collection at the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) in Ancient Egypt. 

```{admonitation}The Library of Alexandria

The Library of Alexandria was one of the largest libraries in the ancient world. Like Callimachus, the library has taken on legendary status in LIS. Please click the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) link on this page to read more at Wikipedia.

Alexandria was (and is) a port city in the Mediterranean.  See the red marker in the map in Figure 1 below (and click to open Google Maps to explore it further in your own browser).

#### The First Catalog: The _Pinakes_

Callimachus’s contribution to knowledge organization (KO) was the [_Pinakes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinakes), “a detailed bibliographical survey” (Casson, 2002, p. 39) relating to the works held in the library in ancient Alexandria. Lionel Casson (2002) provides the full title: _Pinakes:_ _Tables of Persons Eminent in Every Branch of Learning together with a List of Their Writings_.

Bill Katz (1998), in his historical survey of reference materials, provides the following about both the _Pinakes_ and the character of Callimachus:

> The earliest known catalog, bibliography, or some might say an index Callimachus's guide to the contents of the Alexandria Library in the third century B.C. Still, this is a matter of interpretation. It fits in that every index is a bibliography, but not every bibliography an index. The fine definition would have pleased Callimachus, a careful man. (p. 332)

Little is known about the specifics of the _Pinakes._ Most sources seem to agree that the form was 120 scrolls, the inference being that they were made from papyrus (e.g., Norman, n.d.; Pomerantz, 2015) or were “books” (e.g., Casson, 2002, p. 39). 

#### How Little We Know

Sources in LIS are unsure about the nature of the _Pinakes—_they either enumerated all of the works held by the ancient library of Alexandria (Casson, 2002; Chan and Salaba, 2016; Joudrey and Taylor, 2018; Katz, 1998) or served as a “detailed bibliographical survey of all Greek writings” (Casson, 2002, p. 39; c.f. Joudrey and Taylor, 2018; Norman n.d.), made possible according to Lionel Casson because the library of Alexandria contained the vast majority of these works.

Sources seem to agree regarding certain aspects of the _Pinakes._ There is general agreement that authors were grouped by kind of writing, that each author’s name was provided, along with a biographical sketch and a list of his works (these ancient authors would have all been men) in the named genre. The level of certainty presented, as well as the nature of the details for the entry and its organization, differ from source to source. For example, Casson (2002) presents with great certainty the use of alphabetical arrangement “by the first letter alone, of course” for authors within each table (p. 40). Jeremy Norman concurs, pointing out that Callimachus was not the first to use alphabetical order. Casson believes, in addition, that the subsequent list of the authors’ works was presented alphabetically. Norman refers to each table instead as a “class” (citing Blum, p. 152), and provides a block quote from Blum explaining the structure of the entries within. Norman then provides a block quote, this time from Harvard historian Blair, situating the _Pinakes_ historically as neither an innovation in terms of the groupings (i.e., classes, which echoed Aristotle’s work organizing poets) nor in terms of the use of alphabetization. It was, however, an ambitious project in terms of the grand scope it represented.

Authorship of the _Pinakes_ is likewise somewhat uncertain. Bill Katz uses the possessive (i.e., they were “Callimachus’s guide”), but does not further clarify what that means. Casson (2002) goes on to explain that, “there is a general agreement that the compilation \[the _Pinakes_\] grew out of, was an expansion of, a shelflist of the Library’s holdings that Callimachus had drawn up” (Casson, 2002, p. 39). The extent of Callimachus’s contribution might therefore be questioned.

#### Conclusion

Ultimately, the details of Callimachus's work are not known, but he serves as a representation of first efforts to organize resources on a large scale in a massive research library -- all for use by others. Although it would be fascinating to know the specifics of how this work was carried out, the legend reminds information professionals in IO that they are following in a long and venerable tradition.
