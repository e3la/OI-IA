Self Study: What Do You Expect When Searching a Catalog?
========================================================

![](https://missouri.instructure.com/courses/45003/files/7748332/download)  
So far in this course, you have taken several opportunities to search within standard retrieval systems and tools that are freely available. When you were doing that, did you stop to wonder why you were searching the way you were, or what you expected to be able to find?

> For the next five minutes, think about your paper in this class, and the resources that have already been provided in this OER. When you use the library to search for sources for your paper, what expectations do you have about the systems?
> 
> *   Will you expect to search by the names of authors, titles, journal titles, or something else? 
> *   When you review a list of hits, do you expect \*everything\* the library has to be included in the results set?
> *   If book covers are included for one book, do you expect the same for all items displayed?
> *   From within the catalog or the retrieval system, do you have expectations about how you might navigate to different pages or records?
> *   Based on searches in a variety of systems, how do you expect that you will be able to refine or limit your search results? Date? Anything else?
> 
> Finally, think about the expectations you identified. Are they unique to you, or should all systems every where provide this kind of access? Keep these ideas in mind as you move through this Module, as this Module describes expectations and some of the ways IO ensures that retrieval systems and tools can address these expectations.

_Library catalogs in the United States evolved to look the way they do, including the information they include and the kinds of searches they permit, thanks to early pioneers in the field. Next, you will learn a bit more about library catalogs and one of the most influential early catalogers in the United States, Charles A. Cutter._
