WorldCat, instead, is a clearinghouse for MARC records, records that libraries download if they acquire the resource. (Most libraries do not use WorldCat as their online catalog, though that is an [option](https://www.oclc.org/en/worldshare-management-services.html).

If you want to keep track of your collection of materials, you can create an account, find records for books you have, and add them to your LibraryThing collection (aka library).
