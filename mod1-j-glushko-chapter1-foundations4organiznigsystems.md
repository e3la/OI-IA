"Foundations for Organizing Systems" (Glushko, 2016)
====================================================

The next reading is from Bob Glushko's OER. It includes some additional  insight into "information" and is the first chapter the the book he edited. You will encounter ideas similar to what you have already read (possibly formulated in a slightly different way), but also some new ones.
