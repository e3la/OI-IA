They are also the primary property accountability records for museum objects. Catalog records tell you what objects you have, their condition, and where they're located. They provide physical and intellectual access to your museum collection.\r\n","\r\n","##### Enriching cultural value\r\n","\r\n","> Cataloguing underpins many important museum activities, including research, exhibition development, conservation, risk management, publication and outreach work, all of which are dependent on detailed and up-to-date collection information.\r\n","\r\n","> Documenting an object enriches its intrinsic value. The accumulation of information gives an object meaning and context, and results in a stronger understanding of its uniqueness, its contribution to the collection and its reason for being collected in the first place.\r\n","\r\n","* * *\r\n","\r\n","> United States, Federal Depository Library Program.
