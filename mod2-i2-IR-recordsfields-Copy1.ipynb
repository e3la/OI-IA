Some records are constructed to align with standards which are developed to help make the records in multiple kinds of digital environments, an example of a few standards often used in libraries include MARC and Dublin Core. \n","\n","In the ERIC database you just looked at, each record represents an article: [https://eric.ed.gov/?q=lady+gaga&id=EJ1101453 ](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=lady+gaga&id=EJ1101453)\n","\n","And when you clicked on the records to open them, you saw very organized content laid out in a pre-defined way. In fact, you were looking at a display for the fields that compose the record.\n","\n","#### Fields in Database Records\n","\n","Database records tend to have fields. For example in the contacts section of your phone there are fields for name, phone number and address for your each of your contacts. Each contact exists as a record. Field, as a term, has different meanings in different information professions. \n","\n","In libraries one of the most common records to encounter is a MARC record - MARC stands for MA chine-Readable Cataloging record. Libraries were one of the first professions to shift to computerized system, which is why some of the terminology and infastructure can feel old fashioned in our more mature information age. \n","\n","The Library of Congress has a guide to ([Understanding MARC](https://www.loc.gov/marc/umb/um01to06.html#part2)) which asks and answers -\n","\n","> \"Why can't a computer just read a catalog card? The information from a catalog card cannot simply be typed into a computer to produce an automated catalog. The computer needs a means of interpreting the information found on a cataloging record. The MARC record contains a guide to its data, or little \"signposts,\" before each piece of bibliographic information.\n","\n","These signposts are in reference to fields which in MARC are denoted by tags. These tags are 3 digit numbers such as: \n","* 020 which is reserved for the ISBN, \n","* 100 for authors name (personal name main entry),\n","* 245 for title information, \n","* 250 for edition, \n","* 650 for subject headings\n","* And many others.\n","\n","For example - \n","\n","| Signposts (Tags)|(Indicators)|(Subfields)| Data                                                    |\n","|-----------------|------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n","| 100             | 1#         | `$a`        | Arnosky, Jim.                                           |\n","| 245             | 10         | `$a`        | Raccoons and ripe corn /                                |\n","|                 |            | `$c`        | Jim Arnosky.                                            |\n","| 250             | ##         | `$a`        | 1st ed.                                                 |\n","| 260             | ##         | `$a`        | New York :                                              |\n","|                 |            | `$b`        | Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Books,                           |\n","|                 |            | `$c`        | c1987.                                                  |\n","| 300             | ##         | `$a`        | 25 p. :                                                 |\n","|                 |            | `$b`        | col. ill. ;                                             |\n","|                 |            | `$c`        | 26 cm.                                                  |\n","| 520             | ##         | `$a`        | Hungry raccoons feast at night in a field of ripe corn. |\n","| 650             | #1         | `$a`        | Raccoons.                                               |\n","| 900             | ##         | `$a`        | 599.74 ARN                                              |\n","| 901             | ##         | `$a`        | 8009                                                    |\n","| 903             | ##         | `$a`        | $15.00                                                  |`\n","\n","\n","Only about 10 percent of the defined MARC fields are used in most bibliographic records.

In the case of Amazon, you find how to purchase the book.\n","\n","In these cases, the database record you are looking at is _specific kinds of record_ because it **stands in for** the book within the retrieval tool. We call this kind of bibliographic record is a surrogate. \n","\n","Database records can describe all kinds of things: bank balances, flight times, locations of upcoming soccer matches, etc. In information agencies, database records often stand in for a book, a poster, a journal, a video, an article, etc. \n","\n","In the context of databases a surrogate is the description provided of another item, not the item itself. It provides the library patron a summary or abstract of the desired material and if the surrogate is the record in a library catalog it also provides a Call Number or other access path to discover the item itself. In the context of archives and preservation, a surrogate may be a photocopy of an original document which is fragile and shouldn't be handled.\n","\n","```{admonition} Example Surrogate\n","One example of a surrogate that stands in for a book on Amazon ([click here](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Crawdads-Sing-Delia-Owens/dp/0735219095/ref=sr_1_2?crid=AN4MHQCGSNUN&keywords=where+the+crawdads+sing&qid=1580220663&s=books&sprefix=where+the+cra%2Cstripbooks%2C189&sr=1-2)). The web page isn't the book itself, but the information provided stands in for the book. Amazon also has surrogates for other items, like toothbrushes ([click here](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-ProtectiveClean-Rechargeable-HX6810/dp/B078GVMVRH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=TY248EB2EU3G&keywords=toothbrushes&qid=1580220747&s=hpc&sprefix=toothbrushes%2Cstripbooks%2C167&sr=1-5)). All the surrogates, whether for information-as-thing or other kinds of items  serve the exact same purpose. In the case of a library, they help users find out about the material is accessible at the library. In the case of Amazon, surrogates help potential buyers learn about the merchandise and make a purchase.\n","```\n","\n","The screenshot below is another example of a surrogate—this time, a Dublin Core metadata record for a [digital version of a book](https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/71064?show=full) in the MOspace institutional repository:\n","\n","![screenshot of surrogate in MOspace ](mospace.png)\n","\n","In this example of a surrogate, a number of field tags appear in the column on the left.
