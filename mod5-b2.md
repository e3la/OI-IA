# What Is Metadata?

## What Is Metadata?

[metadata](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/metadata.html) as defined by the SAA Dictionary is<br>
> a characterization or description documenting the identification, management, nature, use, or location of information resources (data)<br>

> Notes<br>Metadata is commonly defined as “data about data.” Metadata is frequently used to locate or manage information resources by abstracting or classifying those resources or by capturing information not inherent in the resource. Typically metadata is organized into distinct categories and relies on conventions to establish the values for each category. For example, administrative metadata may include the date and source of acquisition, disposal date, and disposal method. Descriptive metadata may include information about the content and form of the materials. Preservation metadata may record activities to protect or extend the life of the resource, such as reformatting. Structural metadata may indicate the interrelationships between discrete information resources, such as page numbers.

> In terms of archives, MARC format and EAD are standards for structuring descriptive metadata about collections. Dublin Core is a standard for structuring metadata that is intended for describing web resources.
In terms of information technology, metadata includes the documentation of data architecture, properties, and methods necessary to store, retrieve, and use the data in a meaningful manner. To the extent that data is a record, it may also include administrative, descriptive, preservation, and structural information.

Also see how [Metadata](https://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#metadata) is defined according to the ODLIS.

## Structured Information

Focus on this part of the ODLIS definition: "**Structured information** **describing information resources/objects for a variety of purposes**." This is a great place to start. Metadata is structured information. In LAMs, metadata generally is provided to support identification, discovery, selection, use, access, and management. 

Note the difference between these two descriptions of a book:

> "I read a great book last week. It was a biography of Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson."

Author: Isaacson, Walter  
Title: Benjamin Franklin : an American life  
Publisher: Simon & Schuster Paperbacks  
Copyright date: c2003

Both include information about the attributes of a particular book. Only the second makes use of structure in the description. The first description might enable a person to find a bibliographic record for the book in a retrieval system, but the results of a search will be more precise when the structured information is used.

## Encoding Metadata

Module 4 included information on standards for encoding metadata. The encoding is another way of providing "labels" that are machine readable. This labeling enables the retrieval system to differentiate the pieces of information, so that a person can search by author and title, etc. Encoding is not present in the first description. The best one could hope for would be retrieval through a general keyword search. Think back to the discussion about precision. The structured, encoded metadata plays a large role in search results that are precise and relevant. 

The descriptive metadata covered this week assumes that there is an encoding scheme in use that enables a computer to recognize what each piece of data represents. 

**For now, think of metadata as being structured information that helps organize or support understanding of a resource, that is available through a retrieval system or tool.** The surrogates in library catalogs are great examples of metadata records. In a library catalog the contents of the book aren't searchable; it is the metadata in each record that is searched.
