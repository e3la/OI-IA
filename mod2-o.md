# "Beyond Accuracy: Precision and Recall" (Koehrsen, 2018)

To reinforce the notion of precision and recall, the following blog post explains these ideas but from a different perspective.

> Koehrsen, W. (2018, March 3). Beyond accuracy: Precision and recall. _Towards Data Science._ [https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-accuracy-precision-and-recall-3da06bea9f6c](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-accuracy-precision-and-recall-3da06bea9f6c) [[Archive.org saved version]](https://web.archive.org/web/20190714235222/https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-accuracy-precision-and-recall-3da06bea9f6c?gi=e191752fd42f)



#### Notes

*   In this 11-minute read, Koehrsen (2018) applies the classic retrieval notions of recall and precision to data science -- and it really works well!
*   Read this essay carefully, and then reflect on how this applies to the results sets described in the last page.
